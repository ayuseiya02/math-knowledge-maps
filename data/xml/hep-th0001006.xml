<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Personal views are shaped by past experiences and so it may be worth while
pondering a little about accidental circumstances which channelled the course of
one’s own thinking. Meeting the right person at the right time, stumbling across
a book or article which suddenly opens a new window.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Fifty years ago, as eager students at Munich University just entering the phase
of our own scientific research, we were studying the enormous papers by Julian
Schwinger on Quantum Electrodynamics, following the arguments line by line but not
really grasping the message. I remember the feelings of frustration, realizing that we
were far away from the centers of action. But, mixed with this, also some dismay
which did not only refer to the enormous arsenal of formalism in the new developments
of QED but began with the standard presentation of the interpretation of Quantum
Theory. I remember long discussions with my thesis advisor Fritz Bopp, often
while circling some blocks of streets ten times late in the evening, where we
looked in vain for some reality behind the enigma of wave-particle dualism.
Why should physical quantities correspond to operators in Hilbert space? Why
should probabilities be described as absolute squares of amplitudes?, etc., etc.
Since we did not seem to make much headway by such efforts I decided
to postpone philosophy and concentrate on learning what was really done,
which aspects were used in an essential way and were responsible for the
miraculous success of Quantum Theory. Leave aside for a while questions of
interpretation discussed by Bohr and Heisenberg, extrapolations like Dirac’s
transformation theory or von Neumann’s theory of measurement and return to
the more pragmatic attitude pervading for instance the book by Leonard Schiff
on Quantum Mechanics. For this purpose WaIter Heitler’s book ‘<em id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Quantum Theory
of Radiation</em>’ (second part of the first edition) proved immensely helpful. Here
I saw what the typical problems were which Quantum Field Theory tried to address
and I also learned to appreciate the progress made meanwhile by covariant
perturbation theory and Feynman diagrams.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The next great piece of luck for me was (indirectly) caused by Niels Bohr.
In the course of the planning of a great joint European laboratory for high energy
physics (now CERN) he saw the need to introduce a young generation of theoretical
physicists in Europe to this area and offered the hospitality of his Institute.
He called an international conference in 1952 which I could attend and a year
later I got a fellowship for spending a year in Copenhagen. This clearly ended
the frustration of being isolated from the great world. The first fringe benefit
of the 1952 conference was a garden party at the residence of Niels Bohr where
I met Arthur Wightman who gave me the invaluable advice to read the 1939
paper by Wigner on the representations of the inhomogeneous Lorentz group.
Returning to Munich I followed the advice and it was a revelation. Not only
by putting an end to our concern about wave equations for particles with higher
spin but because here I recognized a most natural starting point. The group,
nowadays called the Poincaré group, is the symmetry group of the
geometry of space-time according to the theory of special relativity. What
would be more natural than to ask for the irreducible representations of this
group? Equally remarkable was the result that these representations (more precisely
those of positive energy) correspond to the quantum theory of the simplest physical
system, a single particle. It has just two attributes: a mass and a spin. Everything
that can be observed for such a system, including, as far as possible, a position
at given time, could be expressed within the group algebra. No reference to
canonical commutation relations, guessed from classical mechanics, nor to
the wave picture. The wave equation arises from the irreducibility requirement.
I could not understand why this paper had remained almost unnoticed by the
physics community for such a long time. In fact, even in 1955 I was introduced
at some conference in Paris as: ‘He is one who has read the 1939 paper
of Wigner’. This was indeed my major claim to fame.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Probably all the young theorists who had the privilege of spending a year
as members of the CERN theoretical study group in Copenhagen will remember
this as a wonderful time. The atmosphere at the Institute with the <em id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">spiritus
loci</em>, emanating from the personality of Niels Bohr, and upheld by Aage Bohr and
Christian Møller who was the official director of the study group, combined
in a rare way scientific aspirations on the highest level with a friendliness
discouraging any competitive struggles and allowing everyone to proceed at his
own pace. Though there was some joint topic suggested, at my time it was the
Tamm-Dancoff method and alternatives to perturbation theory, with some emphasis
on nuclear physics, everyone was allowed to work on the subject of his own
choice. So, after a short excursion into nuclear physics I returned to my pet
subjects. Prominent among them was collision theory in quantum mechanics
and field theory. The widely used recipe of ‘adiabatic switching off of the
interaction’ appeared to me not only as ugly but also as highly suspect because the
notion of ‘interaction’ was not clear <em id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">a priori</em> and if one switched off the wrong
thing one would decompose a nucleus into its fragments. This led me to appreciate
the physical significance of various topologies for vectors and operators in Hilbert
space. Since in high energy physics the experiments were not concerned with
fields but with particles there was the idea that the role of a field was just to
interpolate between incoming and outgoing free fields which were associated to
some specific type of particle. Trying to implement this I unfortunately used
the wrong topology. But just at the end of my stay in Copenhagen we received
a preprint of the paper by Lehmann, Symanzik and Zimmermann who did things
correctly and thereby provided an elegant algorithm relating ‘Green’s functions’
in quantum field theory to scattering amplitudes for particles.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Speaking of Copenhagen and quantum theory the ‘Copenhagen interpretation’
immediately comes to mind. I prefer to call it the ‘Copenhagen spirit’ or, more
specifically, the natural philosophy of Niels Bohr. I did have some opportunities
to talk to the great master but, in spite of my great admiration and some efforts,
this was not fruitful. It was only in later years that I understood the depth
of various parts of his philosophy. But there always remained one disagreement
which came from the question: what are we trying to do and what is guiding
us? Physics began by the recognition that there are relations between
phenomena which are reproducible. These could be studied systematically,
isolating simple processes, controlling and refining the conditions under which
they occur. The formulation of the regularities found and the unification of
the results of many different experiments by one coherent picture was achieved
by a mapping into abstract worlds: a world of appropriate concepts and a world
of mathematical structures dealing with relations within and between various sets
of mental constructs, one of them being the set of complex numbers. This endeavor
manifestly led to some level of understanding of ‘the laws of nature’ as evidenced
by the development of a technology which provided mankind with enormous powers
to serve their conveniences and vices. But what was understood and what was
the relative role in this process played by observations, by creation of concepts
and by mathematics? When Dirac wrote on the first pages of the 1930 edition of his
famous book: ‘<em id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">The only object of theoretical physics is to calculate results that
can be compared with experiment</em>’, this can hardly be taken at face value. As
he often testified later, he was searching for beauty and he found it in
mathematical structures. So much so that he preferred to look for beautiful
mathematics first and consider their possible physical relevance later.
Indeed, the road from phenomena to concepts and mathematics is not a one-way
street. As the studies shifted from coarser to finer features the theory could
not be derived directly from experiments but, as Einstein put it, it had to be freely
invented and tested subsequently by suggesting experiments. In this passage
back and forth between phenomena and mental structures many aspects entered
which cannot be rationalized. The belief in harmony, simplicity, beauty are driving
forces and they relate more to musicality than to logic or observations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">There was one further highly significant and somewhat accidental occurrence
in shaping my subsequent work and this may also illustrate the above remarks.
Professors F. Bopp and W. Maak in Munich decided in 1955 that it was
important to exchange experience between theoretical physicists arid
mathematicians. This initiative was not rewarded by visible success. The number
of participants dwindled quickly and the enterprise ended after a few months.
But for me it was of paramount importance. I was introduced there to rather recent
work of the Russian mathematicians Gelfand and Naimark on involutive, normed
algebras and to the work of von Neumann on operator algebras and reduction
theory. I saw that Hilbert space resides in some wider setting which, at least
from the mathematical point of view, constitutes a rather canonical structure
resulting from a few natural structural relations. Besides the standard algebraic
operations it needed a *-operation (involution) and one is led to a natural
topology induced by a unique ‘minimal regular norm’. It appeared highly likely
that this structure was behind the scenes in the mathematical formalism of
quantum theory. The prototype of such an algebra is furnished by group theory.
There a most important tool is the consideration of functions of the group
with values in the complex numbers. They form obviously a linear space because
we can multiply them by complex numbers and add them. If there is a
distinguished measure on the group (which is the case for compact groups
and, up to a normalization factor, for locally compact ones) the group
multiplication defines a product in the space of these functions, the convolution
product. The inverse in the group defines a *-operation in this algebra of functions

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A paper describing some fascinating recent experiments was entitled
‘<em id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Reality or Illusion?</em>’ These experiments (see e.g. refs.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>)
have lent impetus to the long standing discussion about the meaning of reality in
quantum theory. Do the discoveries force us to abandon the naive idea of an outside
world called nature whose laws we try to find? What is the role of the observer? Do the
puzzles relate to the mind-body problem?</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Many different views concerning such questions have been voiced throughout
the past seventy years. So if I try to express mine it may be pardonable to proceed
in an extremely pedantic fashion.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">A single experiment of the type alluded to above combines many individual
clicks of some detectors. Though each click is unique and neither repeatable
nor predictable even under optimally controlled circumstances, we may regard
it as a ‘real fact’ in the sense in which these words are used in any other context.
Let us call it an ‘event’. Its existence is not dependent on the state of consciousness
of human individuals. In modern times it is usually registered automatically,
stored in computer memories and there is no dispute between the members of
a group of experimenters about its ‘reality’. The outcome of the experiment refers
to the frequency with which a particular configuration of events occurs in many
runs and this is reported as a probability of the phenomenon under precisely
described circumstances. To be accepted, this result must be reproducible by any
other group of scientists who is willing to invest time and resources in repeating the
experiment. The events mentioned are coarse. A detector is macroscopic.
We regard macroscopic bodies as ‘real objects’ and statements about their placement
in space and time as ‘real attributes’. The word ‘real’ just means here that
such objects, events and their space-time attributes belong to common experience
shared by many persons and do not depend on the state of consciousness of
an individual. The observed relations between them constitute the only empirical
basis from which the ‘free invention’ of a theory can proceed. With regard to this
mental task there is a piece of wisdom which I learned from F. Hund. It might
be called Hund’s zeroth rule. He pointed out that the progress of physical theory
depended on the lucky circumstance that always some effects were small enough to
remain unnoticed or could be disregarded as insignificant at the time a particular
piece of the theory was proposed. We cannot take many steps at the same time.
We should regard a theory always as preliminary; it will disregard some fine
features of which we are luckily ignorant or which we neglect in order to obtain
a tractable idealization.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The purpose of these lengthy elaborations is twofold. First, I do not think
that physics can make any contribution to the mind-body problem. The attempt
to explain some puzzling aspects of quantum physics by invoking subjective
impressions and the role of the consciousness of individual human beings
is not an appropriate answer. Secondly, the concept of <em id="S2.p4.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">event</em> is necessary in
quantum physics. It is an independent concept. The mental picture that it corresponds
to an interaction process between an atomic object and a macroscopic one is
misleading because experiments tell us that there are no atomic objects in an
ontological sense (see below). Of course, from this we may conclude that there
are no macroscopic objects either and that their apparent reality results from an
asymptotic idealization. This is true (see e.g. the discussion in
ref. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> of
the emergence of classical concepts due to large size and decoherence). But the
idealization is covered by Hund’s zeroth rule and is essential for the form of the
present theory. If we want to avoid it we must take the next step in the development
of the theory. Let us address now some specific aspects.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">1. In experiments we usually (necessarily?) distinguish two parts: a source which
determines the probability assignments (subsumed under the notion of ‘state’),
and a set of detectors to whose responses the probabilities apply. Though in
the description of the source a variety of considerations enter which will have
to be looked at more closely, we shall, for simplicity of language, just idealize
it as characterized by some pattern of ‘source events’. The total setting, consisting
of source events and target events, where the former determine a conspicuous
probability assignment for the occurrence of the latter, may be called a
‘quantum process’. Bohr emphasized the indivisibility of the process as
one of the key lessons of quantum theory. This poses the question of how we
can isolate such a process from the rest of the world. In technical terms, what
do we have to take into account in ‘preparing a state’ in order to get a reproducible
probability assignment for a pattern of target events (defined by some arrangement
of detectors). Here we are helped by lucky circumstances. We live in a reasonably
steady environment; its influence does not change rapidly in space and time.
So, if we are stupid in the state preparation we just get an uninteresting probability
assignment, a ‘very impure state’. The art of the experimenter is needed
to improve state preparation and render the probability assignment as conspicuous
as possible. It appears, however, that there is a limit to such improvements, idealized
by the notion of a ‘pure state’.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">2. Given some definite process one would like to assign to it a ‘physical system’
as the agent producing the target events or, more carefully, as the messenger
between source and target events. This is clearly a mental construct. Can we
attach any element of reality to it? If we focus on a single event involving one
detector far removed from the source we may think of a single particle as
this messenger. But we may also consider patterns of several events, seen in
coincidence arrangements of detectors far removed from the source and from
each other. Then we sometimes find correlations in their joint probabilities which
are of a very peculiar type. If we believe that there is a specific messenger from
the source to each target event (for instance a particle) then, whatever notion of
state we try to assign to those, we cannot represent the joint probability for
the pattern of events as arising from joint probabilities for a corresponding
set of individual states of the messengers. This is the conclusion to be drawn
from the violation of Bell’s inequality. It is not so easily seen in the first
discussions which focused on hidden variables but emerges clearly in
ref. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
Another equally surprising effect has been demonstrated by Hanbury-Brown
and Twiss. They start from two entirely independent source events (for instance
photons emitted from two far distant surface regions of a star which happen
to arrive almost simultaneously in the observatory). So they can cause a
coincidence in two detectors. Each detector responds to one photon but can, of
course, not distinguish from which source event it comes. By varying the difference
of the optical paths from the telescope exit to the two detectors one finds varying
intensity correlations in the coincidence signals. This means that the cause for
the response of one detector cannot be attributed to the arrival of either a
messenger from the left edge or from the right edge of the star. Both photons
work together though there is no phase relationship between the two emission acts.
There is a causal relation between the pattern of two source events and the pattern
of two target events but it cannot be split into causal ties between single events.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Taken together these experiences imply that the notion of a ‘physical system’
does not have independent reality. What is relevant for the click of a single
detector is some notion of ‘partial state’ prevailing in its neighborhood. In both
of the above examples this is described as an impure state of a single particle.
In the EPR-example as discussed by Bell it is determined by one source event,
the decay of an unstable particle. In the second example it is caused by two source
events. The probability for the response of both detectors in coincidence depends
on the partial state in the union of the two neighborhoods and this is apparently
not determined by the pair of partial states around the individual detectors.
Thus quantum physics exemplifies the saying: ‘the whole is more than the sum of
its parts’ and it does so in extreme fashion. The Pauli principle claims that
all electrons in the universe are correlated. The reality behind the mental picture
of a physical system consisting of a certain number of particles refers to a
certain set of events with causal connections between them, manifested
by the existence of a probability for the total process. In an ideal experiment
this is obtained by counting the number of times the pattern of target events is
realized, dividing it by the number of times the source events occured.
In the usually prevailing cases where the source is not adequately

<p id="S2.p9.1" class="ltx_p">3. The reader may have wondered why I specialized the usual notion of ‘observable’
to that of a detector and talked about events instead of measuring results indicated
by the position of a pointer of some instrument. The spectral resolution of
self-adjoint operators which played such an essential role in the development
of early quantum mechanics was not even mentioned so far. One reason for this
is the problem of how to achieve the mapping from a particular arrangement of
instruments to its representative in the mathematical scheme. In early quantum
mechanics the idea that we consider a physical system consisting of a definite number
of particles seemed to pose no problem (a beautiful illustration of
Hund’s zeroth
rule). The degrees of freedom were positions and momenta, appearing in the
canonical formalism of classical mechanics on equal footing. Though it became clear
that these degrees of freedom could not be real attributes of the system one
still talked about measuring one of them (or simple functions of them like energy and
angular momentum). Bohr emphasized that the full description of the experimental
arrangement is needed ‘to tell our friends what we learned’ and that this could
only be done in plain language. But, since the classical degrees of freedom persisted,
this description of the arrangement could ultimately be summarized by one mathematical
object which corresponded in a symbolic way to a classical quantity. How can
one proceed in this passage from the description of an arrangement of hardware
to a mathematical symbol relating to the system? The primary piece of information
is given by the placement of macroscopic bodies in space-time. These bodies
perform different functions. Some parts may be considered as ‘state preparation
procedures’ representing the source events. Other parts yield the measuring
result which is an unresolvable phenomenon, an <span id="S2.p9.1.1" class="ltx_text">unpredictable</span>
<span id="S2.p9.1.2" class="ltx_text">decision</span> in nature,
a coarse event. Its primary attribute is an approximate position in space-time.
The representation of the whole arrangement (apart from the primary source)
by a self-adjoint operator, interpreted as describing the measurement of a
quantity related to some function of the classical degrees of freedom involves
the theory (Schrödinger equation) in conjunction with idealizations and
approximations which are transparent only in simple cases. The operators corresponding
to momentum
and energy have clear significance as generators of translations in space and
time but are only indirectly related to observations, which in the last resort
concern the position of an event in space-time. The position operator of a
particle at a prescribed time yields spectral projectors which can approximately
characterize an event. But the assumed existence of a family of mutually exclusive
events with certainty that one of them must happen is an extrapolation which
becomes highly unnatural in relativistic situations. This is mildly indicated already
by the ambiguities arising in the attempt to define a position operator in Wigner’s
analysis.</p>

<p id="S2.p10.1" class="ltx_p">The fundamental discovery, that the ‘elementary particles’, formerly
believed to be the building stones of matter, are not eternal but can be created
or destroyed in processes, forces us to consider states whose particle content
is not only varying but undefined in some regions. While the concepts of ‘system’
or ‘particle’ suggest some object existing in an ontological sense, the concept of
‘state’ belongs to the realm of possibilities (potentialities, propensities) for the
realization of <em id="S2.p10.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">something coming into existence</em>, an event. This would not be
so in a deterministic theory but if we believe that the indeterminacy in the prediction
of phenomena, inherent in the formulation of quantum physics, is a feature of
the laws of nature and not just due to ignorance which could be lifted by future
studies then the distinction between the realm of possibilities and the realm
of facts becomes imperative. The ‘state’ belongs to the former. Strictly speaking
it provides a quantitative description of a <em id="S2.p10.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">contribution</em> to the probability for
the occurrence of events. The other contribution is given by the placement and
type of detectors. Thus also the notions of ‘system’ and ‘particle’ belong to
the realm of possibilities. But they retain their importance. They allow us
to classify (at least under favorable circumstances) the possible partial
states in a region by a <em id="S2.p10.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">denumerable set</em>.</p>

the superposition principle and eigenvalue problems; more generally, the determination
of invariant subspaces in a complex linear space with respect to the action of the

this mathematical structure (Hilbert space, involutive algebras, representation theory
of groups) offers the key to quantum theory appear to me as a striking
corroboration of Einstein’s emphasis on free creations of the mind and Dirac’s
conviction that beauty and simplicity provide guidance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p12" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p12.1" class="ltx_p">Returning to our line of argument: the ordering of states in classes by the
concept of a ‘system’ corresponds to the selection of an invariant subspace,
under the action of the symmetry group. A minimal invariant subspace, an
irreducible representation, may be called an elementary system. Its attributes are
group characters. If we consider only the symmetry group of space-time,
the Poincaré group, the irreducible representations give us states of a
stable system, a system which could persist eternally if it were alone in
the world and no events could occur. This simple system is a single particle.
Its attributes are a value of the mass and the spin, which define a group
character. The reason why the simplest systems play such an important role
for observations is due to the circumstance that in many experiments the
partial state pertaining to a large but limited region of space-time can
be very closely approximated by the restriction of <em id="S2.p12.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">a global single particle
state</em> to the region. This will, in fact be the standard situation in the overwhelming
part of space-time if the mean density of matter is small. To obtain a basis in the
space of single particle states we must choose some maximal set of commuting
generators. In this choice the generators of space-time <em id="S2.p12.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">translations</em>, whose
spectral values are energy-momentum 4-vectors, play a preferred role in the following
respect. If we look in a region whose extension is small compared to its mean
distance from source events then the partial state there is well approximated
by a mixture of parts of plane waves, (improper) eigenstates of the
generators of translations, each
belonging to a specific energy-momentum vector.</p>

its description as a character of U(1). The generalizations of this in high energy
physics led to flavor and color multiplets associated with the groups SU(2),
SU(3). To avoid misunderstandings it must be stressed that we talk here about
a global gauge group. The significance of local gauge invariance will be addressed
later.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Position and momentum belong to different parts of the scheme. Position is
an (approximate) attribute of an event, not of a particle, and the event marks
a position in space-time not a position in space at an arbitrarily assumed time
(as the picture of a world line for a particle would suggest). In simple cases the
event may be regarded as the interaction process between a particle and a detector.
But the notion of ‘particle’ does not correspond to that of an object existing in any
ontological sense. It relates to the simplest type of global state and describes
possibilities, not facts. The notion of ‘partial state’ demands in addition
that we ignore all possible events outside some chosen region and thus ignore
possible correlations with outside events. The concepts of ‘particle’ and
‘physical system’ arise from the possibility of ordering global states into
distinct classes defined by the symmetry group of the theory. A particle
corresponds to an irreducible representation of this group. Its attributes are
group characters. A system corresponds to some subrepresentation of the tensor
product of irreducible representations. Experience tells us that only a countable
set of irreducible representations (particle types) appears in nature. The determination
of these (the masses, spins, charge quantum numbers of physical particles) is one
of the tasks of the theory.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In observations we are concerned with partial states which result by the
restriction of global states to some regions in which we choose to place
detectors. For a fixed global state the partial state in a region can be approximately
described by the restriction of a global state which belongs to the class of some
specific system. In other words: if we focus attention on some particular region then
the global state may tell us for instance that in there the probability for events is
almost the same as that predicted from the restriction of some single particle
state. Indeed, if we choose the region sufficiently small then it will usually suffice
to consider only mixtures of single particle states with definite momenta. The
existence of zero mass particles complicates this picture somewhat, as evidenced
by laser beams and by infrared problems where the number of particles is no
longer useful for the description of a partial state.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In the whole scheme we still need an observer. No facts are created if no
detectors are around anywhere. Though the consciousness of an individual plays no
role (it was eliminated by the assumed ‘as if’ reality of macroscopic bodies
and coarse events) the scheme still appears somewhat artificial. It is a description
of what we may learn by experiments. But looking at the detailed mathematical
structure, developed to cope with the above mentioned tasks of the theory,
it seems clear that the notions of macroscopic bodies and coarse events are asymptotic
concepts. If, on the other hand, we wish to replace them by finer ones we encounter
difficulties. They can, I believe, not be overcome without a radical change of the
formalism involving our understanding of space and time. As long as there is an
enormous disparity between collision partners, one being a macroscopic body the other
an atomic object, we can talk about an approximate position of the event and give
upper bounds for its uncertainty, relating to the size and the time of sensitivity of
the (effective part of the) detector, and we can give lower bounds for the energy-
momentum transfer needed to overcome the barriers against the appearance
of a significant change. This suffices for practical purposes but does not seem
to be the ultimate answer if we look at the vertex of a high energy event in a
storage ring.</p>

of points in space-time. These are singular objects which have to be smeared
out over some finite regions to yield observables which can be represented
by operators in a Hilbert space. There are problems. Some serious ones are related
to gauge invariance, specifically to the local gauge principle first encountered
in quantum electrodynamics (QED). If one wants to avoid ‘unphysical states’
one has to restrict attention to gauge invariant quantities. From these one may
hope to construct algebras of observables. To be precise: we abstract from this

<p id="S3.p13.1" class="ltx_p">It is my personal conviction that in this step the local gauge principle plays
a crucial role. This assessment stems partly from progress in theoretical
high energy physics in the past decades and partly from my belief in simplicity
and naturalness of fruitful basic concepts. The principle mentioned tells us that
we should not try to focus on global symmetries. In a local theory the symmetries
should only govern the structure in the small and the comparison of their action
in different regions needs additional information which is called a ‘connection’
because the comparison depends on the way we pass from one region to the other.
In the two important classical field theories which have proved their worth for
physics, Maxwell’s electrodynamics and Einstein’s general relativity, this
principle is encoded. In the former it was recognized rather late and refers to the
gauge symmetry related to electric charge; in the latter it was one of the guiding
principles and refers to the Poincaré symmetry of space-time. The Lorentz part,
which keeps one point in space-time fixed, is reduced to a local symmetry for
the tangent space at this point; the translations are replaced by the connection.
Quantum physics as we know and use it is anchored on the uncritical acceptance
of space-time as an arena in which we can place instruments, an arena with
known geometry including a causal structure. Some aspects of the theory depend
also on the existence of a global symmetry for this geometry.<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>Quantum physics

the spectrum condition has to be replaced. A considerable amount of work has been
devoted to this problem but we shall not discuss it here; it would be beyond the scope
of this paper.</span></span></span> If we loose this anchor completely we enter an area in which the
conceptual structure and mathematical formalism of quantum physics cannot persist. In
this area the problem mentioned at the end of section 2 and some of the questions
addressed in the next section may become imperative. So, to stay on the present level,
we wish to keep global Poincaré symmetry and only reduce the internal symmetries,
relating to the charge structure, to local significance needing the definition of
a connection. In a classical field theory the formalism of Yang-Mills theories,
generalizing electrodynamics to non-Abelian local internal symmetry groups, is well
understood, using the notions of sections and connections in a fiber bundle.
The transfer of this formalism to quantum theory is highly nontrivial and, in
my opinion, not yet adequately understood. If we use the approach via algebras
of observables sketched above then the incorporation of the additional structure
due to (not directly observable) local internal symmetries is obscured by the
singular nature of points and lines used in the classical case. To handle this
we need knowledge about the short distance behavior (ultraviolet limit) of the
theory. A few tentative suggestions concerning the notion of a quantum connection
are given in ref. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. I consider the clear understanding of how local internal
symmetries can be incorporated in a well defined mathematical structure as one of the
most important immediate aims on which many subsequent developments may hinge.
It constitutes, of course, a hybrid theory since the global nature of the geometric
symmetries is kept. So it may not be of primary importance to clarify whether the
continuum limit really exists.</p>

for the observer (to enable him to tell what was done and learned)
remains an essential ingredient but, if we disregard questions of convenience,
it may be reduced to the description of geometric relations in the placement
of various macroscopic bodies and the coarse events observed in space and time.
All further information is contained in the mathematical structure. The correspondence
principle needed to map the description into the realm of mathematical symbols is
provided by the reference to classical space-time and its geometric symmetry on both
sides. It is the correspondence (<a href="#S3.E1" title="(3.1) ‣ 3 The mathematical structure in relativistic quantum physics and its interpretation ‣ Questions in quantum physics: a personal view" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.1</span></a>) together with the action of the translation

Apart from
this the global symmetry of space-time is needed in two respects. In a single experiment
because it studies the statistical relations in an ensemble of many individual event

of an event as an irreducible unit and it manifests itself also in the holistic aspect
of the causal relations between events. The isolation of an individual process
as a distinguishable, coherent part in the history of the universe, a pattern of
events which can be considered by itself without mentioning its ties with other
parts, depends to some extent on the choice of the observer of how much
he wants to consider but this choice is limited by the requirement that it must lead
to a well defined conspicuous
probability assignment for the total process, a requirement
which can be precisely fulfilled only in a steady environment.</p>

<p id="S4.p4.1" class="ltx_p">3. The distinction between possibilities and facts which appears to be unavoidable
in a formulation of indeterministic laws implies a distinction between future
and past. Bohr mentions the ‘essential irreversibility inherent in the very concept
of observation’. If the term observation does not mean that the ultimate responsibility
for deciding what constitutes a fact is delegated to the consciousness of an
individual human being<span id="footnote2" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">2</span>I think this would be too unreliable to be useful for
the purposes of physics.</span></span></span> then we must accept the essential irreversibility inherent
in the concept of an event. This endows the ‘arrow of time’ with an intrinsic
significance in the physical theory and corresponds to a picture of reality as
evolving in successive steps of a process with a moving boundary, separating
past facts from future possibilities. It corresponds to the picture drawn
by the philosopher A.N. Whitehead <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. This does not conflict with the
existence of a time reversal symmetry of the theory which describes a symmetry
in the probability assignments for processes. The significance of the arrow
of time is encoded in the existing theory by the spectrum condition for the
energy-momentum of states entering in the characterization of detectors
(which provide one contribution for the probability of an event). The time reversal
operator, being anti-unitary, does not change the sign of the energy.</p>

<div id="S4.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Turning now to perspectives for future development of the theory, we
might take a few hints from the preceding discussion. First, that all
symmetries should be considered as local but that we should not
associate the meaning of ´local´ with a point in a space–time continuum but
with a possible event. A pattern of events with a web of causal ties
between them bears some analogy to a section in a fiber bundle whose
base space is the set of events and the typical fiber is a direct sum of
representations of the symmetry group. The causal ties provide the
connection. The dynamical law must then describe the probability
assignment for different possibilities of growth of such a pattern in
the evolution process in which possibilities turn into facts and the
boundary between past and future changes. Included in this task is the
determination of the subset of representations in the fiber of an
event, the generalized eigenvalue problem yielding the relation
between masses, spins and charge quantum numbers. I shall not try to
elaborate on the many questions connected with such a picture and its
relation to existing formalism. This is beyond the scope of this paper
and the capabilities of its author.
