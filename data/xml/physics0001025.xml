<p id="id6" class="ltx_p">Consequences of the basic and most evident consistency
requirement—that measured events cannot happen and not happen at the same
time—are shortly reviewed.
Particular emphasis is given to event forecast and event control.
As a consequence, particular, very general bounds on the forecast and
control of events within the known laws of physics result.
These bounds are of a global, statistical
nature and need not affect singular events or groups of events.</p>

David Hilbert polemicised against “another

<div id="S0.SS0.SSSx1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S0.SS0.SSSx1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Just as in mathematics, inconsistency, i.e., the coexistence of truth
and falseness of propositions, is a fatal property of any
physical theory. Nevertheless, in a certain very precise sense, quantum
mechanics incorporates inconsistencies in a very subtle way, which
assures overall consistency. For instance, a particle
wave function or quantum state is said to “pass” a double slit through both
slits at once, which is classically impossible. (Such considerations may, however, be
considered as mere trickery quantum talk, devoid of any operational meaning.)
Yet, neither a particle wave
function nor quantum states are directly associable with any sort of
irreversible observed event of physical reality.
We shall come back to a particular quantum case in the second part of this investigation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S0.SS0.SSSx1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S0.SS0.SSSx1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">And just as in mathematics and in formal logic it can be argued
that too strong capacities of intrinsic event forecast and intrinsic event control
renders the system overall inconsistent.
This fact may indeed be considered as one decisive feature in
finite deterministic (“algorithmic”) models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
It manifests itself already in the early stages of Cantorian set theory:
any claim that it is possible to enumerate the real numbers
yields, via the diagonalization method, to an outright contradiction.
The only consistent alternative is the acceptance
that no such capacity of enumeration exists.
Gödel’s incompleteness theorem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> states that
any formal system rich enough to include arithmetic and elementary logic
could not be both consistent and complete.

<p id="S0.SS0.SSSx1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In what follows we shall proceed along very similar lines.
We shall first argue that any capacity of
total forecast or event
control—even in a totally deterministic environment—is
contradicting the (idealistic) idea that decisions between alternatives are possible;
stated differently: that there is free will.
Then we shall proceed with possibilities of forecast and event control
which are consistent both with free will and the known laws of physics.</p>
</div>
<div id="S0.SS0.SSSx1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S0.SS0.SSSx1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">It is also clear that some form of forecast and event control
is evidently possible—indeed, that is one of the main achievements of
contemporary natural science, and we make everyday use of it, say, by switching
on the light.
These capacities derived from the standard natural sciences are
characterized by a high chance of reproducibility, and therefore do not
depend on single events.</p>

<div id="S0.SS0.SSSx1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S0.SS0.SSSx1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">In what follows, we shall concentrate on very general bounds of
capacities of forecast and event control;
bounds which are imposed upon them by the requirement of consistency.
These considerations should be fairly general
and do not depend on any particular physical model.
They are valid for all conceivable forms of physical theories; classical,
quantum and forthcoming alike.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsubsection">Strong forecasting</h2>

<div id="S0.SS0.SSSx2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S0.SS0.SSSx2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Let us consider forecasting the future first.
Even if physical phenomena occur
deterministically and can be accounted for (”computed”) on a higher
level of abstraction, from within the system such a complete description
may not be of much practical, operational use
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S0.SS0.SSSx2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S0.SS0.SSSx2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Indeed, suppose there exists free will. Suppose further that an agent could
predict <span id="S0.SS0.SSSx2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">all</span> future events, without exceptions.
We shall call this the
<span id="S0.SS0.SSSx2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">strong form of forecasting.</span>
In this case, the agent could freely decide to
counteract in such a way as to invalidate that prediction.
Hence, in order to avoid inconsistencies and paradoxes,
either free will has to be abandoned,
or it has to be accepted that complete prediction is impossible.</p>
</div>
<div id="S0.SS0.SSSx2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S0.SS0.SSSx2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Another possibility would be to consider strong forms of forecasting
which are, however, not utilized to alter the system.
Effectively, this results in the abandonment of free will,
amounting to an extrinsic, detached viewpoint.
After all, what is knowledge and what is it good for if it cannot be
applied and made to use?</p>
</div>
<div id="S0.SS0.SSSx2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S0.SS0.SSSx2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">It should be mentioned that the above argument is of an
ancient type <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.
As has already been mentioned,
it has been formalized recently in set theory, formal
logic and recursive function theory, where it is called
“diagonalization method.”</p>
</div>
<div id="S0.SS0.SSSx2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S0.SS0.SSSx2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In doing this, we are inspired by the recent advances in the foundations
of quantum (information) theory.
There, due to complementarity and the impossibility to clone
generic states, single events may have important meanings to
some observers, although they make no sense at all to other observers.
One example for this is quantum cryptography.
Many of these events are stochastic and are postulated to
satisfy all conceivable statistical laws (correlations are nonclassical,
though).
In such frameworks, high degrees of reproducibility cannot be
guaranteed, although single events may carry valuable information,
which can even be distilled and purified.</p>

<p id="S0.SS0.SSSx3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A very similar argument holds for event control and the production of
“miracles” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.

Suppose further that an agent could entirely control the future.
We shall call this the <span id="S0.SS0.SSSx3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">strong form of event control.</span>

In order to avoid a paradox, either free will or some
physical laws would have to be abandoned, or it has to be accepted that
complete event control is impossible.</p>

and its occurrence in a test is equally likely, although the
“meaning” an observer could ascribe to it is rather different.
These sequences may be embedded in and be part of much longer stochastic
sequences. If short finite regular (or “meaningful”) sequences are
padded into long irregular (“meaningless”) ones, those sequences
become statistically indistinguishable for all practical purposes
from the previous sequences.
Of course, the “meaning” of any such sequence may vary with
different observers.
Some of them may be able to decipher a sequence, others may not be

for “conditions of possible [[quantum]] experience.”
There, the agent should concentrate on influencing the <span id="S0.SS0.SSSx5.p9.2.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">coincidences</span>
of the event rather than the single individual events.
In such a case, the <span id="S0.SS0.SSSx5.p9.2.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">individual</span> observables may behave perfectly random,
while the associated <span id="S0.SS0.SSSx5.p9.2.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">correlations</span> might be nonclassical and even
stronger-than-quantum and might give rise to highly nonlocal phenomena.
As long as the individual events cannot be controlled,
this needs not even violate Einstein causality.
(But even then, consistent scenarios remain <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>.)</p>

<div id="S0.SS0.SSSx5.p10" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S0.SS0.SSSx5.p10.1" class="ltx_p">In summary it can be stated that, although total forecasting and event control
are incompatible with free will, more subtle forms of these capacities remain
conceivable even beyond the present laws of physics; at least
as long as their effects upon the “fabric of phenomena”
are consistent.
These capacities are characterized by singular events and not on the
reproducible patterns which are often encountered under the known laws
of physics.
Whether or not such capacities exist at all remains an open
question.
Nevertheless, despite the elusiveness of the phenomenology involved,
it appears not unreasonable that the hypothesis might be
testable, operationalizable and even put to use in certain contexts.
