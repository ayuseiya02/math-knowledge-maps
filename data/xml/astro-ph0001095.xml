<p id="id5" class="ltx_p">We report the results from measuring the phase lag and coherence
function of X-ray emission from black hole candidate (BHC) XTE
J1550-564. These X-ray temporal properties have been recognized to
be increasingly important in providing important diagnostics of the
dynamics of accretion flows around black holes. For XTE J1550-564,
we found significant hard lag — the X-ray variability in high
energy bands <span id="id5.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">lags</span> behind that in low energy bands — associated
both with broad-band variability and quasi-periodic oscillation
(QPO). However, the situation is more complicated for the QPO: while
hard lag was measured for the first harmonic of the signal, the
fundamental component showed significant <span id="id5.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">soft</span> lag. Such behavior
is remarkably similar to what was observed of microquasar GRS 1915+105.
The phase lag evolved during the initial rising phase of the 1998
outburst. The magnitude of both the soft and hard lags of the QPO
increases with X-ray flux, while the Fourier spectrum of the
broad-band lag varies significantly in shape. The coherence function
is relatively high and roughly constant at low frequencies, and begins
to drop almost right after the first harmonic of the QPO. It is near
unity at the beginning and decreases rapidly during the rising phase.
Also observed is that the more widely separated the two energy bands
are the less the coherence function between the two. It is interesting
that the coherence function increases significantly at the frequencies
of the QPO and its harmonics. We discuss the implications of the
results on the models proposed for BHCs.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Black hole candidates (BHCs) are characterized by rapid X-ray
variability (see recent reviews by van der Klis 1995 and Cui 1999a).
It is also common for BHCs that the variability at high energies lags
behind that at low energies (Cui 1999a and references therein), which
is often referred to as hard lag. The hard lag is often attributed
to thermal inverse-Comptonization processes (e.g., Miyatomo et
al. 1988; Hua &amp; Titarchuk 1996; Kazanas et al. 1997; Böttcher
&amp; Liang 1998; Hua et al. 1999), which are generally thought to be
responsible for producing the characteristic hard tail in the X-ray
spectra of BHCs (Tanaka &amp; Lewin 1995). In these models, the hard lag
arises simply because a greater number of scatterings are required for
seed photons to reach higher energies. Therefore, the lag is directly
related to the diffusion timescale through the Comptonizing region,
which scales logarithmically with photon energy (e.g., Payne 1980;
Hua &amp; Titarchuk 1996). The expected logarithmic energy-dependence of
the hard lag is in rough agreement with the observations (Cui et
al. 1997; Crary et al. 1998; Nowak et al. 1999). However, the measured
lag is often large (e.g., a few tenths of a second) at low frequencies,
which would require a very extended Comptonizing region (Kazanas et al.
1997; Böttcher &amp; Liang 1998; Hua et al. 1999). It is not clear
whether such a region can be physically maintained (Nowak et al. 1999;
Böttcher &amp; Liang 1999; Poutanen &amp; Fabian 1999). Suggestions have
also be made to link the hard lag either to the propagation or drift
time scale of waves or blobs of matter through an increasingly hotter
region toward the central black hole where hard X-rays are emitted
(Miyamoto et al. 1988; Kato 1989; Böttcher &amp; Liang 1999) or to the
evolution time scale of magnetic flares (Poutanen &amp; Fabian 1999).
Regardless which scenario turns out to be close to reality, it is clear
that the hard lag is an important property of BHCs which we can use to
gain insight into the geometry and dynamics of accretion flows in these
systems.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Recently, however, it was discovered that a strong QPO in GRS 1915+105,
a well-known microquasar, had a rather complex pattern of phase lag
(Cui 1999b): while the hard lag was measured for the odd harmonics
of the signal, the even harmonics displayed <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">soft</span> lag. The
pattern is puzzling because it does not fit naturally into any of the
models suggested for BHCs. Speculation was made that the complicated
QPO lag in this case might be caused by a change in the form of the
wave that produced the QPO (Cui 1999b). It is, however, not clear what
physical mechanisms could be responsible for such evolution of the wave
form. Similar behavior was subsequently observed for some of the QPOs
in XTE J1550-564 (Wijnands et al. 1999). Therefore, the
phenomenon may actually be common for BHCs.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">A related timing property to the phase lag is the coherence function
between two different energy bands. Only recently, however, enough
attention is paid to the importance of this property (Vaughan &amp;
Nowak 1997) and efforts are made to compute it along with the phase
lag. Consequently, the results are very limited. It is nevertheless
interesting to note that for BHCs the coherence function often
appears to be around unity over a wide frequency range — the X-ray
variabilities in different energy bands are almost perfectly linearly
correlated on those timescales in Fourier domain (Vaughan &amp; Nowak 1997;
Cui et al. 1997; Nowak et al. 1999). This puts additional
constraints on the models for X-ray production mechanisms in BHCs.
Lower coherence was observed of Cyg X-1 when the source was in the
transitional periods between the two spectral states (Cui et
al. 1997). This could be attributed to the variation of the
Comptonizing region during those episodes on timescales less than an
hour (Cui et al. 1997), in the context of Comptonization models (Hua
et al. 1997). However, more data is required to verify such a
scenario.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this Letter, we present the results from measuring the phase lag
and coherence function of X-ray variability for XTE J1550-564 during
the initial rising phase of the 1998 outburst (Cui et al. 1999, Paper
1 hereafter). In addition to the intense aperiodic variability, a
strong QPO was detected, along with its first and sometimes second
harmonics, and the frequency of the QPO increased by almost 2 orders
of magnitude during this period (Paper 1). We examine the timing
properties of both the QPO and broad-band variability.</p>

briefly, there were 14 RXTE observations, covering the rising phase

<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We chose the 2 – 4.5 keV band as the reference band. A cross-power
spectrum (CPS) was computed for each 256-second data segment between
the reference band and each of the higher energy bands. The results
from all segments were then properly weighed and averaged to obtain
the CPSs for the observation. The phase of a CPS represents a phase
shift of the light curve in a selected energy band with respect to
that of the reference band. We followed the convention that a positive
phase indicates that the X-ray variability in the high energy band
lags behind that in the low energy band, i.e., a hard lag. The
uncertainty of the phase lag was estimated from the standard
deviations of the real and imaginary parts of the CPS. For the phase
lag associated with a QPO, the magnitude was derived from fitting the
CPS in a narrow frequency range around the QPO with a linear function
(for the continuum) and two Lorentzian functions whose centroid
frequencies and widths were fixed at those of the QPO (Paper 1).

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In all observations, significant hard lag was found to be associated
with the broad-band variability. The phase lag shows significant
evolution during the rising phase, which can be divided into two
distinct periods. Fig. 1 shows an example for each period Fourier
spectra of power density, phase lag, and coherence function. At the
early stage of the rising phase, the broad-band hard lag is
significantly measured only in the middle range of frequencies. The
lag increases with frequency first, peaks at some characteristic
frequency, and then decreases. The peak frequency does not appear to
correspond to any characteristic features in the power density
spectrum (PDS). At the frequency of the QPO, <span id="S3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">soft</span> lag is clearly
detected, on top of the broad-band hard lag. However, there does not
appear to be significant phase lag (hard or soft) associated with the
first harmonic. At the later stage of the rising phase, while the hard
lag is still apparent there also seems to be significant <span id="S3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">soft
lag</span> associated with the broad-band variability at frequencies around
the QPO and its harmonics. The soft lag associated with the
fundamental component of the QPO remains significant, but now <span id="S3.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">hard</span> lag is also measured for the first harmonic. As for the coherence
function, it is high and nearly constant at low frequencies and drops
off sharply almost right after the first harmonic of the QPO for both
periods of the rising phase. It is interesting to notice that at the
frequencies of the QPO and its harmonics the coherence function
increases significantly.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Both the broad-band and QPO lags show strong energy dependence, as
illustrated in Fig. 2. They become larger at higher energies (with
respect to the reference band), which is typical of BHCs (Cui 1999a).
The QPO lag also shows correlation with X-ray flux (and thus with the
QPO frequencies; Paper 1) for the second period of the rising phase,
as is apparent in Fig. 3. Both the soft and hard
QPO lags increase as the source brightens, reaching as high as 0.1
and 0.3 radians, respectively. The coherence function is near unity
at the beginning of the rising phase. Subsequently, it decreases
rapidly and seems to level off in the end. To quantify the evolution,
we averaged the observed values over a frequency range 0.004-0.1 Hz
where the coherence function is roughly constant. As an example, the
results for the 8.1-13.3 keV band are plotted in Fig. 4. The loss of
coherence is apparent during the initial rising phase. Moreover, the
coherence function also decreases as the separation between the two
energy bands widens, as shown in Fig. 5.</p>

frequency where the <span id="S4.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">phase lag</span> peak. This is unusual because
for other BHCs the time lag seems to monotonically increase toward
low frequencies (e.g., Miyatomo et al. 1988; Cui et al. 1997; Grove
et al. 1998; Nowak et al. 1999). In the context of Comptonization
models, such a saturation in time lag might be the manifestation of
the finiteness of the Comptonizing region (Hua et al. 1999). If so,
the characteristic frequency (a few Hz) would provide a direct measure
of the outer radius of the region (i.e., tens of lt-ms), which seems
to be in rough agreement with that estimated from the measured time
lag. It is interesting to notice that the characteristic frequency
appears to increase as the source brightens, perhaps indicating that
the size of the Comptonizing region decreases, as was suggested for
Cyg X-1 when the source goes from the hard (or low) state to the soft
(or high) state. However, it is puzzling why the lag spectrum appears
so different at the later stage of the rising phase, or more
specifically what causes the observed broad-band <span id="S4.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">soft</span> lag around
the QPO and its harmonic (see Fig. 1).</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The complex pattern of the phase lag associated with the QPO bear
remarkable resemblance to that observed of GRS 1915+105 (Cui
1999b). Perhaps, the phenomenon is common for certain types of
QPOs in BHCs. Combined with the published results (Wijnands et al. 1999),
our results show that the phenomenon seems generic for
XTE J1550-564, as opposed to being limited to certain spectral states.
More importantly, we are now seeing the evolution
of the phenomenon as the QPO evolves during the rising phase of the
outburst. If we accept the Comptonization scenario for the broad-band
lag, we would have to rule out this scenario for the QPO because
the QPO time lag <span id="S4.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">increases</span> with X-ray flux during the rising
phase (see Fig. 3). This would not be surprising, since, as discussed
by Cui (1999b), it is problematic to attribute the observed soft and
hard lags of the QPO (and its harmonic) entirely to
inverse-Comptonization processes in the first place. At present, no
models can naturally account for this type of phase lag phenomenon.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In the context of Comptonization models, the loss of coherence during
the rising phase may be due to the variation in the physical
conditions of the Comptonizing region (Hua et al. 1997), as was
suggested for Cyg X-1 during spectral state transitions (Cui et al.
1997). This scenario might also explain why more widely separated
energy bands are less coherent (see Fig. 5), since the difference in
the number of scatterings that seed photons experience is greater.
The observed Fourier spectra of the coherence function are, however,
somewhat unusual. For a number of BHCs, the coherence function is
typically close to unity over the entire frequency range where it can
be reliably determined (e.g., Vaughan &amp; Nowak 1997; Cui et al. 1997;
Nowak et al. 1999). Here, the coherence function drops precipitously
above a “break frequency” (which appears to be near the first harmonic
of the QPO; see Fig. 1). We speculate that the break frequency might
be indicative of the timescale on which the Comptonizing region varies.
The break frequency appears to evolve in unison with the frequency of
the QPO, which could
imply that (1) the QPO originates in the Comptonizing region (instead
of the accretion disk, as often thought) and (2) the Comptonizing
region varies on an increasingly short timescale during the initial
rising phase of the outburst. The former is also supported by the fact
that the QPO becomes stronger at higher energies (Paper 1; also see
discussion in Cui 1999b). For BHCs in general, such energy dependence
of QPOs is observed in most cases (Cui 1999a). Associating the QPO with
the Comptonizing region directly might also account for the intriguing
increase of the coherence function at the frequencies of the QPO and
its harmonics, if the QPO is more localized, given that the broad-band
variability is probably a disk phenomenon and Compton upscattering of
disk photons in an extended non-static “corona” can cause the loss
of coherence.</p>
