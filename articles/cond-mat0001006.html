<p id="id1" class="ltx_p">The field of condensed matter physics had its genesis this century
and it has had a remarkable evolution. A closer look at its growth
reveals a hidden aim in the collective consciousness of the field
- a part of the development this century is a kind of
warm up exercise to understand the nature of living condensed matter,
namely the field of biology, by a growing new breed of scientists
in the coming century. Through some examples the vitality of this
interaction will be pointed out.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">‘Condensed Matter Physics’ (CMP) is a clever name for the study of
any form of matter that is condensed - liquids, solids, gels,
cells, superfluid He4, quantum Hall liquid etc etc. The folklore
is that the name ‘Condensed Matter Theory’ was coined in Cambridge
in the 60’s in the solid state group that involved people like V. Heine
and P.W. Anderson. Of course, before this field was christened
it existed, on its own right as solid state physics and related
fields with very many significant developments to its credit -
the new name gave it an added identity and perhaps a new purpose.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Physics, a part of Natural Science, is an experimental science.
It gains its strength from experiments, observations, theorizing,
and impact on technology and society. CMP has a special place in physics
because of its closeness to a multitude of feasible and often novel
experiments. This feasibility is intimately tied with the wealth of
matter and associated phenomena around as well as the
development in the field of material science and in turn technology -
both low and high tech. Elegant concepts from quantum physics,
statistical mechanics, mathematics are combined alive so that it
continues to produce surprises and new phenomena and new concepts.
This field is also a source for innovative new experimental methods
that has extended human ‘senses’ to atomic scale - modern x-ray
crystallography, NMR, neutron scattering, spectroscopy, scanning
tunneling microscope and so on.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The aim of the present article is to provide a point of view
that this field has grown, partly with an aim to address deeper
issues in the field of living condensed matter namely biology;
and a century of efforts is really a warm up exercise towards
this difficult goal. The point of view I am providing is perhaps
obvious - my main message is that a true resonance between
the two fields is something that is natural and so likely to
happen or has already begun.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">II </span>Nature of Condensed Matter Physics</h2>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">CMP is diverse and complex. It addresses issues such as why
silicon has a diamond like structure using quantum mechanical
considerations, or the growth dynamics
of snow flakes, or the electrical conduction in carbon nanotubes.
There is CMP in the field effect transistor,
modern computer chips and the sensitive SQUID magnetometer that
detects the feeble electrical activity that goes on in our restless
brain.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The field is messy but rewarding. Quantization of
Hall conductance, that won 2 Nobel prizes,
occur amidst disorder and interaction.
While the field is diverse, there are powerful unifying notions
and ideas: spontaneous symmetry breaking, order parameter,
renormalization group, complex collective behavior, quantum coherence,
chaos etc. The idea of renormalization group is an an example
that has grown out of the study of condensed matter
systems such as liquid-gas phase transition and Kondo problems - it
has far reaching application potential including possibility of
understanding some hierarchical structures in biological systems
to turbulence in classical fluids.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The field of CMP possesses a deep working knowledge of quantum
mechanics, both in theory and experiments. This gives it an
unique strength and also makes its relation to biology special.
The stability of atoms, the origin of chemical bonds,
electron transfer, proton tunneling etc. in biology
are truly quantum mechanical. However, it is fair to say that some
mysterious leaking of quantum effects to some unexpected aspects
and domains of biology (such as the origin of consciousness),
apart from the above obvious ones. are distinct perhaps remote
possibilities. CM physicists will not accept such suggestions uncritically,
but will have a natural edge in unraveling those which turn
out to be meaningful.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Physics gains its predictive power and becomes a quantitative
science because of the powerful use of mathematics -
analysis and approximations intertwined with physical
insights, order or magnitude estimates, dimensional analysis and
many modern mathematical ideas such as homotopy theory,
group theory, algebraic geometry, functions of many complex variables
etc. In view of the remarkable developments in computers computational
CMP is becoming very popular and powerful. Often you can do a
computer simulation or experiment and create situations that you
find it hard to create in the laboratory, or study analytically.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">I alluded to the complexity of the study of condensed matter.
This gives it a remarkable ability to suggest new paradigms
through its emergent character<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, that could be helpful
elsewhere. The last several decades have seen
some of them: i) spin glass and neural network, and ii) self organized
criticality, power laws etc. These notions may not have solved the
real problem of biology - but they are some new windows for physicists
to look at this totally new world of biology. The wealth of phenomena
in condensed matter is sure to provide seeds of new paradigms
provided we look for them and and develop a sensitivity to abstract them.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">III </span>Nature of Biology as a science</h2>

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Like physics, biology is truly an experimental science. Most of the
problems in biology are far too complex, at the moment, to be analyzed
threadbare, the way we do in physics with some problems, using our
existing knowledge and concepts of physics, chemistry and mathematics.
However, after the revolutionary beginning of the field of molecular
biology<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>
at the middle of this century, biology has taken a new shape, and
looks comfortable even
for a physicist to look at from a distance. Very general principles
like Darwin’s natural selection to very specific structure
and function relations in DNA, proteins, etc. are dominating the field
currently. There are also many dogmas, hard earned hypothesis and
working principles that pervade this truly diverse field -
protein structure, signal transduction, brain function to name
a few. Thanks to the
experimental tools like x-ray crystallography, electron microscopy,
NMR imaging, ATM, STM, optical tweezers and so on, that actually
came from physics, the field is undergoing revolutionary development.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The urgent problem facing a hard core biologist is often very different
from what a physicist, genuinely interested in biology, is capable of
solving in a short time period. This is the reason many biologists
sincerely feel that physicists can not solve the mysteries of biology.
On the other hand, physicists like Schroedinger, Max Dellbruke,
Crick, Hopfield and others have made truly original contributions
and opened up new directions. It is becoming clear that physics
is not just providing experimental tools to other fields such as
biology, it is evolving capabilities and insights to understand
the spirit of biology.</p>

<div id="S4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Having made several general remarks let me indicate some examples,
based on my one decade of a distant admiration for
biology - it is so distant that biology does not know that I am
dreaming of her !</p>

<p id="S4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">A brain would naturally like to think about how it thinks;
why grey matter-a large piece of condensed matter possesses
consciousness, self awareness, minds eye-I etc. Physicists
have no clues as to how the laws of quantum mechanics, thermodynamics
or even quantum gravity for that matter, leads to these profound
properties in a living state of condensed matter. After listening to
an illuminating talk by John Hopfield on neural network and associative
memory<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> in the fall of 1987 at Princeton, I thought, in a moment of
weakness, that I understood the physics of the mind ! - soon to
realize it is far from it.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p4.1" class="ltx_p">It is becoming increasingly clear that all our understanding
of spin glass physics, that came from partly the study of a dilute
concentration of magnetic impurities in an otherwise pure gold, has only
landed us somewhere at the plains of the Himalayan range, we have
to scale Mount Everest. The concept of
network, basin of attraction, possible hierarchical or ultra metric
organization of attractors, are all but words in constructing a long
poem. This became clear to me, when I participated in an Institute
of Theoretical Physics, Santa Barbara workshop
on ‘Neurobiology for physicists’ in the fall of 1987, where
neurobiologists humbled us with mind boggling biological and clinical
facts about the brain. But, at the same time, our successful
understanding of the neural network of sea slug,
an organism that has few hundred
neurons, gives us hope that perhaps one day we can understand
mammalian brain, with all its complexities and hierarchies.
It is clear that all our efforts so far has been a warm up exercise.</p>

it gave an opportunity to many physicists like me, to get a glimpse
of the world of biology with problems that are even more challenging
than the power law correlation in the nucleotide sequence.
Genetics is full of many surprises - gene replication,
gene repair, translation, gene regulation etc. All my initial
enthusiasm to model the DNA as a one dimensional 4 state Potts model
with long range interaction and frustration soon gave way to other

an egg) cell. It is a network that is very different from
the neural network or immune network or the spin glass or glass.
At the same time it is a network that should posses some general
characteristics of any large networks - this is what prompted
Kaufman, for example, to invent a Boolean net to model gene

<p id="S4.p11.1" class="ltx_p">Szent-Gyorgyi, an eminent biochemist, speculated on the importance
of electron transport in biological systems including DNA. He along
with others have speculated that it could hold some of the the
secret of carcinogenesis. Possible connection to cancer apparently
got a lot of (unjustifiable ?) funds - that is a
different story. The point is that the lightest of charged
particles in biology, namely electron, is involved in too many
vital activities.
Within proteins electron transport is well studied in biology for
the last many decades. There are reaction centers, typically a
prosthetic group such as a porphyrine complexing a metal
ion, embedded in protein. On absorbing a light quanta the reaction
center releases an electron that tunnels through a couple of tens
of angstrom distance through the folded protein before it is
absorbed by another special complex, just to trigger another
reaction; then it continues sometimes ending up in an ion transfer
across the membrane, if it were a membrane bound protein.</p>

<p id="S4.p14.1" class="ltx_p">Structure and function are catch words in biology often used
at the level of DNA or enzyme functions. In a different
context, in bacterial photo synthesis certain geometrical arrangement
of porphyrine complexes have given new insights into mechanism of
energy transport by exciton. The structure of the basic unit of the so
called light harvesting complex has been deciphered a couple of
years ago<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
There are two types of ring complexes one containing one concentric
circle of 18 porphyrine molecules that are stacked in a circle like
slides in a circular slide box. The other contains two concentric
rings with the
reaction center complex at the center. These ring complexes are
organized on the surface of the cell in some quasi periodic fashion.
The incident photon is absorbed by the porphyrine to create an
exciton which propagates to end up in the reaction center to activate
an electron transfer reaction.
To this complex geometrical arrangement one can apply, as Ramakrishna
and myself attempted among others<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, our knowledge of exciton transport
in molecular crystals. Already there are many surprises - one always
felt that the exciton transport is an incoherent hopping process
at the physiological temperatures.
But within the ring complex the exciton transport has been shown to
be coherent experimentally and theoretically. Our feeling is that
between the ring complex also , through Forster mechanism,
there is some coherence and possibility of new physics.</p>

structural units and their organizations - apart from circular complexes
there are cylindrical complexes and light guides. What we have learned

evolution has not chosen structures that are manifestly periodic.
However, there are remarkable regular, sometimes symmetric and
hierarchies of structures. For example if we look at the virus T4, there are
a few types of basic proteins that make up the so called pro head -
a complex of proteins that has icosahedral symmetry that encapsulates
the viral DNA. Then there is a neck, again made up of protein complexes
and a body (that looks like a bit of micro tubule) - a cylinder made up
of proteins and the legs made of proteins. This tiny little ‘robot’
is different from a periodic crystal. However there is some regularity
in its making.</p>

<div id="S4.p19" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p19.1" class="ltx_p">And condensed matter physicist is tempted to wonder about the assembly
of this complicated macromolecular robot. The physics is not exactly
that of the growth of a sugar crystal. It is
a self assembly that is regulated. It is non equilibrium
statistical mechanics that is embedded in a signaling network.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p20" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p20.1" class="ltx_p">The regulated self assembly is a
new notion that is very unique to and ubiquitous in biology.
The above is only an example of the many hierarchical structural
organizations that one comes across in biology - morphogenesis,
micro tubules, myosin complex, collagen fibers, fibrils etc.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p21" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p21.1" class="ltx_p">In fact I learned about this notion of regulated self assembly
during my sabbatical at Princeton in 1996, in a Cell Biology course
organized by Stan Leibler and Frank Wilczek. It became clear
in that course, that had distinguished attendees like
Curtis Callan, Stephen Adler and others, that there are many
challenging and profound problems. We physicists returned
spell bound at the end of every class on learning new wonders in
cell biology and felt the need for serious investigations by many
physicists.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p22" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p22.1" class="ltx_p">Finally a word about some macro molecular structural changes in biology.
Structural rearrangements in biology are in plenty. A heme protein,
as soon as it gets an oxygen, undergoes a conformational change
so that it can bind the second oxygen more easily and so on.
An allosteric protein like the motor protein, once it gets an
ATP undergoes a massive conformational or structural change, that
is like an elementary step in walking. Our well known notions
such as soft modes or anharmonic interactions that we are
used to in structural changes in simple solids, are far from
sufficient to understand even the simplest macro molecular structural
change - we have to think afresh. People like Frauenfelder, Austin,
Stein, Wolynes and others have made a start at this.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The trend of many condensed matter physicists taking a serious look at
biology is visible for a long time.
One also hears of new Institutes and ventures like Santa Fe Institute
which catalyses new kind of activities and exchanges. In a special
section devoted to ‘Complexity Science’, a recent issue of
Science<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>
enumerates about a dozen Universities and Labs in the
United States trying to set up new across the disciplinary ventures
involving physics and biology departments, just at the turn of
this century. This has started happening
in a natural fashion in developed nations like the US or Europe.
The developing countries will do well to recognize this and
participate and contribute to this resonance and redefinition
among disciplines in science.</p>
