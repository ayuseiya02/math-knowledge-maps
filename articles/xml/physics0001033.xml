<p id="id2" class="ltx_p">We recall the origins of differential calculus from a modern perspective.
This lecture should be a victory song, but the pain makes it to sound more as a
oath for vendetta, coming from Syracuse two milenia before.</p>
</div>
<div id="p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p1.1" class="ltx_p">A visitor in England, if he is bored enough, could notice that our
old 20 pound notes are
decorated with a portrait of Faraday
imparting the first series of ”Christmas
lectures for young people”, which
began time ago, back in the XIXth century, at his suggestion. Today they
have become
traditional activity in the Royal Institution.</p>
</div>
<div id="p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p2.1" class="ltx_p">This year the generic theme of the lectures was quantum theory and the
limits implied by it. The BBC uses to broadcast the full sessions during
the holidays, and I decided to enjoy an evening seeing the recording.
This day, the third of the series, is dedicated to the time scale
of quantum phenomena. The main hall is to be occupied,
of course, by the children who have come to enjoy the experimental
session, and the BBC director, a senior well trained to control
this audience, keeps the attention explaining how the volunteers
are expected to enter and exit the scene. While he proceeds
to the customary notice, that ”<span id="p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">all the demonstrations here are done
under controlled conditions and you should not try to repeat
them at home</span>”, I dream of a zoom over a first bowl with some
of the bank notes, and the teacher starting the lecture.</p>
</div>
<div id="p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p3.1" class="ltx_p">He wears the white coat and in a rapid gesture drops a match in
the bowl, and the pieces of money take fire. The camera goes

<p id="p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Money. Man made, artificial, unnatural. Real and Untrue.</span></p>

<div id="p5" class="ltx_para">

</div>
<div id="p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p6.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">But take a look
to this graph: Why does it move with the same equations that a
grain of pollen? Why does it oscillate as randomly as a quantum
mechanic system?</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p7.1" class="ltx_p">Indeed. It is already a popular topic that the equations used for the
derivative market are related to the heat equation, and there is
some research running in this address. But the point resonating in
my head was a protest, formulated<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">20</span></a>]</cite> a couple of months before by
Mr. W.T. Shaw, a researcher of financial agency, Nomura:</p>
</div>
<div id="p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p8.1" class="ltx_p">”Money analysts get volatility and other parameters from the measured
market data, and this is done by using the inverse function theorem.
If a function has a derivative non zero in a point, then it is
invertible at this point. But, if we are working out discrete
calculus, if we are getting discrete data from the market, how
can we claim that the derivative is non zero? Should we say that
our derivative is <span id="p8.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">almost non zero</span>? What control do we have over
the inversion process?”.</p>
</div>
<div id="p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p9.1" class="ltx_p">Most meditations in this sense drive oneself to understand the hidings under
the concept of stability of a numerical integration process.</p>
</div>
<div id="p10" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p10.1" class="ltx_p">But consider just this: discrete, almost zero, almost nonzero calculus!.
It is a romantic concept by
itself. Infinitesimals were at the core of the greatest priority dispute
in Mathematics. On one side, at Cambridge, the second Lucasian chair,
Newton. On the other side, at the political service of the elector of
Mainz, the mathematical philosophy of Leibniz. And coming from
the dark antiquity, old problems: <span id="p10.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">How do you get a straight line from
a circle? How do you understand the area of any figure? What
is speed? Is the mathematical continuum composed of indivisible
”individua”, mathematical ”atoms without extension”?</span></p>
</div>
<div id="p11" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p11.1" class="ltx_p">Really all the thinking of calculus is pushed by two paradoxes. That one
of the volume and that one of the speed.</p>
</div>
<div id="p12" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p12.1" class="ltx_p">The first one comes, it is said, from Democritus. Cut a cone with a plane
parallel and indefinitely near to the basis. Is the circle on the plane
smaller or equal than the basis?</p>
</div>
<div id="p13" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p13.1" class="ltx_p">Other version makes the infinite more explicit. Simply cut the cone parallel
to the basis. The circle in the smaller cone should be equal to the one
in the top of the trunk. But this happens for every cut, lets say you make
infinite cuts, always the circles will be equal. How is that different of
a cylinder? You can say, well, that the shape, the area, decreases between the
cuts, no in the cuts. Ok, good point. But take a slice bounded by two
cuts. As we keep cutting we make the slice smaller, indefinitely thinner,
until the distinction between to remove a slice and to make a cut is
impossible. How can this distinction be kept? And we need to kept it in
a mathematically rigorous way, if possible.</p>
</div>
<div id="p14" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p14.1" class="ltx_p">The second paradox is a more popular one, coming from
the meditations of Zeno. In more than one sense, it is dual to the
previous one. Take time instead of height and position instead of circular
area. How can an arrow to have a speed? How can an arrow to change position
if it is resting at every instant? In other version, it is say that it
can not move where it is fixed, and it can not move where it is not yet. Or,
as Garcia-Calvo, a linguist and translator of Greek, formulated once:
”One does not kiss while he lives, one does not live when
he kisses”.</p>
</div>
<div id="p15" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p15.1" class="ltx_p">Seriously taken, the paradox throws strong doubts about the concept of
instantaneous speed. Or perhaps about the
whole conception of what ”instantaneous” is. While Democritus asked how
indefinite parts of space could add up to a volume, Zeno wonders how a
movement can be decomposed to run across indefinite parts of time. A Wicked
interplay.</p>
</div>
<div id="p16" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p16.1" class="ltx_p">It is interesting to notice that physicists modernly do not like to
speak of classical mechanics as a limit <math id="p16.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\hbar\to 0" display="inline"><semantics id="p16.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="p16.1.m1.1.4" xref="p16.1.m1.1.4.cmml"><mi mathvariant="normal" id="p16.1.m1.1.1" xref="p16.1.m1.1.1.cmml">ℏ</mi><mo id="p16.1.m1.1.2" xref="p16.1.m1.1.2.cmml">→</mo><mn id="p16.1.m1.1.3" xref="p16.1.m1.1.3.cmml">0</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="p16.1.m1.1b"><apply id="p16.1.m1.1.4.cmml" xref="p16.1.m1.1.4"><ci id="p16.1.m1.1.2.cmml" xref="p16.1.m1.1.2">→</ci><csymbol cd="latexml" id="p16.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="p16.1.m1.1.1">Planck-constant-over-2-pi</csymbol><cn type="integer" id="p16.1.m1.1.3.cmml" xref="p16.1.m1.1.3">0</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-llamapun" id="p16.1.m1.1c">ID:Planck-constant-over-2-pi ARROW:to NUMBER:0</annotation><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="p16.1.m1.1d">\hbar\to 0</annotation></semantics></math>, but as a cancellation
of the trajectories that differ from the classical one. Perhaps this
is more acceptable. Anyway,
the paradoxes were closed in false by Aristotle with some deep thoughts
about the infinity. Old mathematics was recasted for practical
uses and, at the end, lost.</p>
</div>
<div id="p17" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p17.1" class="ltx_p">But in the late mid ages, some manuscripts were translated again. A man
no far from my homeland, in the Ebro river in Spain, took
over a Arabic book to be versed into Latin. It was the <span id="p17.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Elements</span>, that
book all you still ”suffer” in the first courses of math in the primary school,
do you remember? Circles, angles, triangles, and all that. And, if your teacher
is good enough, the art of mathematical skepticism and proof comes
with it.</p>
</div>
<div id="p18" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p18.1" class="ltx_p">Of course the main interesting thing in the mid ages is a new art, Algebra.
But that is a even longer history. To us, our interest is that with
the comeback of geometry, old questions were again to be formulated.
<span id="p18.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">If continuous becomes, in the limit, without extension, then is such
limit divisible? And if it is indivisible, atomic, how can it be?</span></p>
</div>
<div id="p19" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p19.1" class="ltx_p">That automatically brings up other deterred theory to compare with. That
one which postulates Nature as composed with indivisible atoms but,
having somehow extension, or at least some vacuum between them.</p>
</div>
<div id="p20" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p20.1" class="ltx_p">Such speculation had begun to be resuscitated in the start of the XVII,
with Galileo Galilei himself using atomic theory to justify heat, colours,
smell. His disciple Vincenzo Viviani will write, time-after, that then, with
the polemic of the book titled ”Saggiatore”, the eternal prosecution
of Galileo actions and discourses began.</p>
</div>
<div id="p21" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p21.1" class="ltx_p">Mathematics was needing also such atomic objects, and in fact the first
infinitesimal elements were named just that, atoms, before the modern
name was accepted.</p>
</div>
<div id="p22" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p22.1" class="ltx_p">(By the way, Copernico in “De revolutionibus” explains how the atomic
model, with its different scales of magnitude, inspires the
astronomical world: the distance of the earth to the center
of the stars sphere is said to be negligible by inspiration
from the negligibility of atomic scale. It is very funny that some centuries
later someone proposed the ”planetary” model of atoms.)</p>
