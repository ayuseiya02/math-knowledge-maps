Eight large FIFOs were used to buffer event segments, which were then
compressed and formatted by 54 processors housed in 6 VME crates. Data was
written continuously to 42 Exabyte tape drives at the rate of 9.6 Mb/s.
During the 1991 fixed target run at Fermilab, 20 billion physics events
were recorded on 24 000 8 mm tapes; this 50 Tb (Terabyte)

short lived particles containing a charm quark. Events involving charm quarks
are rare and difficult to recognize in real time. The experiment’s strategy
was to impose only loose constraints when recording data, and select the
events of interest offline when time and computing resources are more
available. Therefore the DA system must collect and record data very quickly.</p>

along eight parallel data paths. The buffers stored 80 Mb of data apiece,
enough to allow the rest of the DA system to be active during both the spill and
interspill. Care was taken to ensure that each data path carried about the
same amount of data. Data are distributed through Event Buffer Interfaces

particle energies. Gas Čerenkov detectors performed particle

The detector elements were digitized by various electronics systems, which
were in turn managed by front-end controllers which delivered data to the
DA system. The front-end hardware is summarized in Table 1.</p>

The data paths from the controllers conformed to the EFB inputs, which were
32-bit wide RS-485 lines accompanied by a single RS-485 strobe. Data was
delivered at a maximum rate of 100 ns per 32-bit word. Each event segment
on the data paths was delimited by a leading word count, calculated and placed
there by the data path’s front-end controller. A 4-bit event synchronization
number was generated for each event by a scaler module and distributed to all
front-end controllers. The controllers accepted this number and made it a part
of each event’s segments. The DA system used the synchronization number to
assure that all event segments presented at a given moment derived from the
same event in the detector. Finally, because we had 16 digitizing controllers
and only 8 data paths, each data path was shared by two front-end controllers
using simple token passing.</p>

0.24 Mb/s. Our solution was to use 2 MTCs per VME crate, and connect them

in each VME crate. It managed the other CPUs in its crate, and controlled
the crate’s magnetic tape system. Finally was EH, the Event Handler program
which ran in several CPUs in each VME crate. Event Handlers did most of the
real work, reading and checking event data, formatting and compressing events,

Only one CPU in each crate could be in the grabber state at any given time.
The grabber’s sole duty was to read event segments from the EFBs and place them
in a large internal event array, big enough to hold 200-300 events. When the
crate Boss noticed that a grabber’s event array was becoming quite full, it
changed that grabber to the munching state, and appointed a new grabber.
Because the throughput of the entire system depended on efficient event
grabbing, grabbers were free of all other obligations, and the grabbing code
was written in assembly language.</p>
</div>
<div id="p35" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p35.1" class="ltx_p">Munchers took events from their event arrays, formatted and compressed the
data, and grouped events into physical blocks suitable for output to tape.
Munching the data could take several times longer than grabbing it, so that
at any moment each crate would have one grabber and several busy munchers.
Munchers were also subject to other obligations, such as responding to
requests for status information and binning histograms requested by the
operator.</p>
</div>
<div id="p36" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p36.1" class="ltx_p">In order to achieve high system throughput from these rather slow processors,
event grabbing had to be orchestrated very carefully. At the start of data
taking, one grabber would be appointed in each crate, and one crate would be
designated number 1. As data arrived in the EFBs, the grabber in crate 1
would extract the event segment from EFB 1 and pass that buffer’s token to
crate 2. As the grabber in crate 1 moved on to reading the second segment of
the first event from EFB 2, the grabber in crate 2 would start reading the
first segment of the second event from EFB 1. Soon the grabbers in all six
crates would be active, each reading from a different EFB. Because there were
eight EFBs but only six crates with one grabber each, all the grabbers would
be busy all the time.</p>
</div>
<div id="p37" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p37.1" class="ltx_p">Normally the crate Boss would replace a grabber with a new one before the
old grabber’s event array became full. If that reassignment were delayed, the
existing grabber would simply pass tokens through to the next crate without
reading data, giving up the event to other grabbers that might be able to
handle it. Only if all grabbers were glutted with data and no event handlers
could be recruited as new grabbers would data taking slow down.</p>
</div>
<div id="p38" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p38.1" class="ltx_p">As grabbers read data from the EFBs, they checked to ensure that the event
segment word counts were reasonable and that all event segments being joined
together in an event had the same event synchronization number. Illegal
word counts and unsynchronized events usually indicated that a front-end
readout system had failed. To overlook such a failure would be very serious;
pieces of unrelated data could end up being joined together into a bogus
event, and the error would propagate forward for all subsequent events. When
such failures were noted, the grabber notified its Boss, the Boss notified
the VAX, and the VAX inhibited data taking, flushed the EFBs, and instructed
the system to restart. Synchronization errors occurred with depressing
regularity throughout the data taking, so it was fortunate that the DA system
had the ability to recognize and respond to them quickly and automatically.
A few spills a day were thus lost.</p>

<div id="p39" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p39.1" class="ltx_p">Event munching consisted of compressing the TDC data from the drift chambers
(which arrived in a very inefficient format), formatting each event so that it
conformed to the E791 standard, and packing events into tape buffers for
output. Munchers did not control tape writing however; they submitted output
requests to their Boss, who queued the necessary commands to the tape
controller, checked the status, and notified the event handler when the tape
buffer could be reused. Each muncher had 10 tape buffers, each capable of
holding a full-sized tape record of 65532 bytes. Although the Boss managed
all tape writing, the data itself never passed to the Boss; the MTC extracted
the data directly from the event handler’s tape buffers.</p>

Since the TDC data was a large fraction
of the total, it was important to compress the data, to conserve tape writing
bandwidth and minimize tape use. In choosing readout hardware for high-rate
experiments, it is important to evaluate the details of the data format very
carefully (although in this instance we had no alternate choice of vendors).

<p id="p42.1" class="ltx_p">The CPU running the Boss program controlled the scheduling of each EH
as a grabber or muncher. It polled the EHs on a regular basis to check the
need for rescheduling. The main criteria to retire a grabber and select a new
one was whether the input event arrays were full or nearly full. When the
system was heavily loaded, protection against too frequent rescheduling
was applied.</p>
</div>
<div id="p43" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p43.1" class="ltx_p">Managing tape writing was also the Boss’s job. The Boss made periodic
requests to all EHs for a list of tape buffers ready for writing. The EHs
responded by giving the boss the VME address and the length of their full
tape buffers. The Boss used the information to construct the commands for the
MTCs. The Boss also selected which MTC and tape drive to send a tape buffer
to, based on how full the MTC’s command queue was and how full the tape in the
drive was. The MTCs performed the block transfer of the tape buffer from the
EH processor to the Exabyte tape drive. When a tape buffer was written, the
MTC informed the Boss, and the Boss in turn notified the EH that the particular
tape buffer was ready for reuse.</p>
</div>
<div id="p44" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p44.1" class="ltx_p">The Bosses were also responsible for gathering status information and
reports of recoverable errors and passing the information to the VAX program.
The Bosses sent occasional Request Sense commands to the drives, which returned
the number of blocks written to tape and the number of blocks rewritten (soft
write errors). All commands sent to the Exabyte drives were returned by the
MTC with a status block, and if a drive error occurred while writing data, the
status block gave details on the error type. Drive errors of some types were
not recoverable, and the offending drive was taken offline until the end of
the data taking run. Likewise, any EH which did not respond to Boss commands
within a given time limit was reset and temporarily removed from the active
system. Event processing could continue even if a few EHs or Exabyte drives
failed since there were multiple drives and EHs in each VME crate. The
throughput of the DA system would be slightly reduced, but not stop.</p>

<p id="p46.1" class="ltx_p">The VAX program managed and monitored the rest of the DA system. A
schematic is shown in Fig. 3. The DA Control Console is shown in Fig. 4,
and provided the user with general status information and a command menu.
In regular data taking the user executed a LOAD after the tapes were placed
in the drives, then a START to begin a data taking run. Another option was to
read out the detector without sending the events to tape (START NOTAPE).
During data taking the run could be suspended for a short time (PAUSE, RESUME)
and under special circumstances the user could clear the EFBs (CLEAR_BUFF).
The Bosses polled the tape drives for fullness of the tapes, and sent the
information to the VAX program. When 20% of the active drives were 95% full,
the VAX program automatically sent the END command. The user could also END
data taking whenever he wished.</p>
</div>
<div id="p47" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p47.1" class="ltx_p">In ending data-taking runs, it was necessary to allow a smooth run down of
the system. The VAX first inhibited the triggers to stop the flow of data
into the EFBs. The Bosses stopped the current grabber and did not schedule
another one. The VAX cleared any data that remained in the EFBs, but all the
events that were already in the EH input event arrays were allowed to be
written to tape. The VAX waited until the Bosses reported that all tape writing
was complete and file marks written before informing the user that the run was
ended. The user could not START another data taking run or execute the tape
drive UNLOAD command until this END process was complete.</p>
</div>
<div id="p48" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p48.1" class="ltx_p">The EHs stored a few events for online monitoring. During data taking,
the VAX retrieved these events and passed them on to an event pool managed by
VAXONLINE software [7]. The event pool was accessible by other VAX
workstations in the local cluster, and an entirely separate set of programs
analyzed and displayed the pool events for online monitoring of the detector.
Typically, the rate at which events were sent to the pool for was fast enough
for most monitoring needs. The DA system also provided a much faster
alternative detector monitoring method. Monitoring a detector typically means
making histograms (hit maps) of the detector elements. One can look for dead
or noisy channels. Part of the EH munching code constructed such histograms
upon user request. The user specified a particular section of the detector to
histogram using a very simple program; the program sent the request to the VAX
DA program using a DEC Mailbox facility. The request was distributed to the
VME EH processors, and all the EHs in the system would accumulate all events
for a period of about one minute. The Bosses and ultimately the VAX summed up
the histogram contributions from each EH, and entered the final product into
the event pool as a special event type. The user’s program retrieved the
histogram from the event pool and could use a variety of means to display it.
In this way the user could get a hit map of a part of the detector with high
statistics, 200 000 events or so, in a very short time.</p>

<div id="p49" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p49.1" class="ltx_p">The VAX program retrieved status information from the Bosses on a regular
basis while a data taking run was in progress. Information such as the
numbers of events processed, the fullness of the tapes, and any errors that
occurred were displayed on various monitors and on the DA Control Console.
For every data taking run, a disk file was created which held a unique run
number, the date and time the data was recorded, the number of events written
to each drive during the run, the drive’s soft error rate as a percent of
blocks written, and whether the drive failed during the run. This file of
numbers was entered automatically into an electronic database when the run was
ended.</p>

<div id="p51" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p51.1" class="ltx_p">The DA system hardware performed well. As mentioned earlier, the system
was tolerant of errors encountered by CPUs running the EH program and of
Exabyte drives with write errors. While all the hardware components in the
system experienced some infant mortality in the initial testing phases, all
the components, with one exception, had very few failures in 9 months of data
taking. The exception was the Exabyte drives, which, after 2000 hours of
operation, will often require head replacement. System wide failures that
halted data taking were extremely rare, and recovery if they did occur was
rapid.</p>
</div>
<div id="p52" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p52.1" class="ltx_p">Running in a test mode, data was pushed into the DA system from the front end
controllers at a rate exceeding real data taking. The DA system then gave
a maximum data rate to tape of about 9.6 Mb/s, or 1.6 Mb/s through each VME
crate. Throughput in each part of the DA system components were well matched.
The data rate into the EFBs times the length of the beam spill matched the size
of the EFBs; the grabbing speed matched the munching speed times the number of
munchers in each VME crate; the output rate from each crate matched the tape
writing speed times the number of drives per crate. However, during real data
taking, the maximum 9.6 Mb/s throughput was usually not attained simply
because the accelerator did not deliver enough beam to create the events.</p>
</div>
<div id="p53" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p53.1" class="ltx_p">In a 5 month period of data taking in 1991 and early 1992, E791 recorded
20 billion physics events on 24 000 8 mm tapes.
This 50 Tb data set is
now being analysed at parallel RISC computing facilities similar to those used
previously in E769 [8]. The experiment’s goal of 100 000
reconstructed charm
particle decays should easily be met.</p>
</div>
<div id="p54" class="ltx_para">
<p id="p54.1" class="ltx_p">The parallel architecture of the E791 DA system is central to its success.
The performance of the system could be increased with more parallel front-end
controllers for faster read out, larger Event FIFO Buffers, faster CPUs with
much better I/O capability, and by upgrading the 0.24 Mb/s Exabyte 8200 drives
to double–speed, double–density Exabyte 8500 tape drives.</p>
