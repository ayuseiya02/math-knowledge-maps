<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The title assigned to this talk, while certainly both
eye-catching and pithy, doesn’t make any literal sense in English.
“Physics needs for future accelerators” is a phrase which
could be interpreted in any number of ways, leading to very different
sorts of talks. Let me begin, therefore, by briefly describing
the roads <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">not</span> taken in my review. This will allow me to
mention some important issues which, while not the focus of
my talk, are worthy of serious high-minded discussion in
international forums such as the Lepton-Photon meetings.</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This, it seems to me, is the
most obvious literal interpretation of the original title.
Since, like all theorists, I consider myself to be
essentially omniscient, I even briefly considered giving
such a talk. I went as far as dusting off my copy
of Jackson <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, 
which contains, after all,
most of the basic physics that you will need to build future accelerators.

<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">This facetious exercise illustrates a worrisome development
to which we had better start paying more attention.
Since (in principle) all of us
understand the basics of accelerator physics, there is a
disturbing tendency to denigrate this essential branch of our
field, to relegate it to “technicians” –the implication
being that first-rate minds are drawn to more “cutting-edge”
physics problems. Combined with the general trend towards
increasing specialization, we have largely decoupled and
discounted an activity which in fact largely defines and
limits the future of our field.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Furthermore, if you look seriously at
the designs and R&amp;D work related to any of the
proposed future accelerators
–linear colliders <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, 
hadron colliders <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, 
as well as very ambitious ideas like the
muon collider <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, 
or the CLIC two-beam acceleration concept <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>– 
you will find
a host of interesting and highly challenging physics problems.
As a community, I doubt that we are doing enough towards
attracting, training, supporting, and encouraging
the next generation of accelerator physicists –the cadre of
first-rate, creative, and experienced people without whom
no future accelerators are likely to get built. In that case
everything else I say in this talk addresses a moot topic,
since we will have failed before we have even properly begun.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">How can we avoid this calamity?
One way to attract new talent to accelerator R&amp;D,
and to validate the importance of this activity,
is for more experimentalists –and even theorists–
to devote some finite fraction of their time to thinking about
accelerator physics problems.
We should keep in mind that lack of technical experience
has the positive virtue of stimulating new kinds of
questions, new ways of thinking, and thus ultimately
to innovation.
Bringing fresh minds to bear
on these sorts of problems can only help, and will enhance
the prestige, and thus the overall vigor, of these activities.
Small steps in this direction can be encouraged now with
existing resources; a few years down the road we should aim
to establish new centers for advanced accelerator physics.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The payoff for nuturing this branch of physics will be
well worth the investment, and could be spectacular.
It may well be, for example, that physics innovation,
rather than engineering or manufacturing breakthroughs,
is the key to major cost reductions in linear collider
or hadron collider designs.

discovering the Higgs. The B factories coming on line now
will provide fundamental new inputs to our global view of
particle physics, including, most likely, some surprises.
The same can be said for the many neutrino experiments in

whatever theoretical prejudices seem most fashionable at the moment.
Although I will myself be guilty of this sort of theorizing
later in the talk, I don’t think this is the best approach

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The first thing we need to do is to discredit some
harmful dogmas which have been clouding our thinking about
high energy physics for more than a decade.
Anyone who falls under the spell of these dogmas is
not likely to hold rational or constructive views
about the future needs of our field.
As far as I know, no one is willing to admit authorship
of these pernicious doctrines, but certainly the
bourgeois overlords of high energy physics and their
running dog lackeys (i.e. this audience) must assume
responsibility for tolerating or promulgating these
ideas.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The basic crime here is to have allowed the misapprehension
–among ourselves, students, and the public– that particle
physics is “almost done”. This misapprehension arises from
two rather different but equally radical notions, which I
will now briefly review.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.SSS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This is the dogma that high energy physics has been
to a large extent supplanted by a new activity called
string theory. 
String theory is the one true
Theory of Everything (TOE), people who are a lot
smarter than you will have it figured out any day now,
and they will soon be able to compute the electron mass, etc.
purely on the basis of mathematical consistency.
Thus the traditional activities of high energy physics
(such as experiment) have become largely irrelevant.
Put another way, since no future accelerator can ever
directly probe the most fundamental scale of physics,
the “bottom up” approach is pointless, and we should
instead invest in the more promising “top down”
approach to connecting fundamental physics with our
existing data banks.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.SSS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.SSS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">This extreme view is, of course, quite silly. String theory
does indeed hold great promise for advancing our understanding
of fundamental physics, and has already produced some profound
insights about black hole physics, about gauge theories, and
other areas as well. But anyone who has followed the rapid
advances in string theory knows that, for every question
successfully disposed of, three new ones seem to crop up in its
wake. Fundamental physics is, not surprisingly, rich, dense,
and confusing. The road to fundamental understanding will be
a long road, and this makes the traditional activities of
high energy physics (such as experiment) even more interesting
and important in that light.</p>

There are a few things left to do –we’ll find the Higgs,
measure a few more parameters– and then that’s it. So
unfortunately young physicists entering the field today
are coming in at the tail end of the Golden Age, but
–tough luck– there’s only one Golden Age and ours is almost

and smaller distance scales, and as our theoretical frameworks
struggle to produce a coherent explanation of what we see,
our fundamental view of the physical world and how to describe it
changes dramatically. High energy physicists are continually
engaged in a process of creating new frontiers, moving to those frontiers,

two phenomena. One phenomenon is that particle physics
during the past decade was in
one of those recurring phases where theoretical assimilation of
earlier experimental findings dominates (to some extent)

fact during this period our understanding has increased dramatically,

<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Let me now be much more explicit about the present status of
particle physics, and about the process of getting to the
next iteration of our understanding. The key realization
here is that the Standard Model is an effective field theory.
As advocated in
Ken Wilson’s pioneering work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, 
quantum field
theories in general are nonperturbatively defined
as effective field theories valid below some explicit
ultraviolet cutoff <math id="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\Lambda" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi mathvariant="normal" id="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">Λ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1.1">Λ</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-llamapun" id="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1c">Lambda</annotation><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.SS2.p1.1.m1.1d">\Lambda</annotation></semantics></math>. The parameters of the effective Hamiltonian
can be regarded as encoding the effects of integrating out
the ultraviolet degrees of freedom above the cutoff scale,
including the high momentum modes of the light degrees
of freedom. Effective Hamiltonians can contain an
arbitrarily large number of operators, but at energies small
compared to the cutoff the effects of higher dimension
operators are suppressed by powers of energy divided by

<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The Standard Model, of course, is famously renormalizable.
However, as emphasized by
Steven Weinberg <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, 
the power-counting renormalizability of the Standard Model has
no particular physical significance. The physically important
sense in which the Standard Model is renormalizable is that
the ultraviolet divergences of the model are controlled by
gauge symmetries, such that counterterms exist to cancel
all infinities. In this sense effective gauge field theories
with higher dimension operators are also renormalizable.
Renormalizability is in no sense an indication that the
Standard Model is “fundamental”. Our generic expectation
is that the full Standard Model Hamiltonian will turn out to
contain a number of higher dimension operators, whose effects
are too suppressed to have shown up in present experiments.
Indeed it is this expectation which makes precision low energy
experiments interesting as probes of new physics.</p>

the physics driving various proposals for future accelerators.

To be concrete and focus our thinking I have summarized
these proposals below according to
my opinion of what we might have and when.
The dates of course are only estimates, but the groupings
are important. It is important in thinking about future machines
to make a clear distinction between those which are intended
to operate in the LHC era, and those which are clearly post-LHC
successors. It is also important to discriminate between those
proposals which extend the energy frontier, and those which
would operate within the energy frontier defined by the LHC.

first determine that we have weak scale supersymmetry, that
we have gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking, that this is

It will be a big job to pin down this new physics, and, in particular,
to link this new physics to anything else in the Standard Model
We will certainly need precise and overconstrained measurements of the
lepton mass matrix, just as we are now achieving for the CKM matrix
of the quark sector. Flavor problems are hard, and it seems highly
probable that we will need to build at least one new accelerator
facility optimized for neutrino physics.

the basic is to use a
muon storage ring as a source for very intense beams
of fairly high energy neutrinos.
The muon charge, momentum, and polarization determine
the neutrino composition and spectrum, thus the
initial characteristics of the neutrino beam will
be known with high confidence.
Many types of oscillation experiments can be
considered <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>,

such as Fermilab to Gran Sasso or CERN to Brookhaven.
This presents the opportunity for
<span id="S3.SS3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">truely</span> international collaborations.

serious detector challenges to be overcome,

<p id="S3.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">My belief that the neutrino factory can be brought
on line as an LHC era facility is based mostly on
its moderate size, and upon the growing interest and
enthusiasm exhibited in many quarters for this idea.
However a number of serious technical obstacles stand
in the way of this goal, and without an especially
aggressive R&amp;D effort my rosy scenario will not
come to pass. Since a neutrino factory appears
also to be the most practical path to a muon collider,
we have an especially strong motivation to pursue
this idea as vigorously as possible.</p>

physics is such that, if you want a new energy frontier
collider in 2020, you had better be doing serious R&amp;D
for it now. This puts us in something of a quandry, since
we don’t yet know how to estimate
the next interesting energy scale.
From the arguments reviewed in this talk we

example, to explore the new physics of the
post-LHC era,
will a 3 or 4 TeV lepton collider, or an LHC
upgrade, be good enough, or do we need to push
straight to
a 10–15 TeV muon collider or 100–200 TeV VLHC?

the existence of extra dimensions, <span id="S3.SS4.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">the effective

In this case hard scatterings at future
