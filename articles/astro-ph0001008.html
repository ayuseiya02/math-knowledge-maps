to lead to detectable disturbances of the Earth’s upper atmosphere
(Fishman &amp; Inan 1988). Most of the energy of the bursts is released
in the 0.1-1 MeV range. Spectra generally display featureless smooth
continua (for a review, see Teegarden 1998).</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The first GRB was recorded with the <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Vela </span>satellites on July 2,
1967 (Klebesadel, Strong, &amp; Olson 1973;
Strong, Klebesadel, &amp; Olson 1974; for a historical review see
Bonnell &amp; Klebesadel 1996). The precise localization of a GRB
on the sky has been an unsolved challenge for ground-based
astronomy for 30 years, although more than 2000 bursts were
detected by numerous space-based experiments during this
timespan. This unsatisfactory observational situation led to an
enormous flood of publications (see Hurley
1998a), and culminated in more than 100 theories about the nature of the
bursters, ranging from solar-wind
models to topological defects at cosmological distances
(in the early years of GRB research there were in fact more theories
than bursts; see Nemiroff 1994; Ruderman 1975). The main
reason for the missing identification of the burster population was
that prior to 1997 no small, arcmin-sized GRB error boxes were available
for rapid follow-up observations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In the mid 1980’s it was recognized that there is a subclass among the
GRBs which are distinguished from the majority of the bursts (Laros et
al. 1986, 1987). These bursts have a soft, thermal Bremsstrahlung

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The 1990’s have seen two observational breakthroughs in GRB
research. The first came with the <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Burst and Transient Source
Experiment (BATSE) </span>on the <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory </span>(<span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">CGRO</span>; Fishman 1981; Fishman et al. 1993, 1994). It characterizes
the period from 1991 to 1996. During this period several GRB
experiments aboard various satellites were carried out, but <span id="S2.SS1.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">BATSE </span>was most successful.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In operation since 1991, <span id="S2.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">BATSE </span>detects about 1 burst/day,
corresponding to a full sky rate of about 800 a year (Meegan et
al. 1992). Based on <span id="S2.SS1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">BATSE </span>observations it became obvious in
the early 1990’s that the bursters must be located either deep in a
Galactic halo or at cosmological distances (Meegan et al. 1992; for
reviews, see Blaes 1994;
Dermer &amp; Weiler 1995; Fishman &amp; Meegan 1995; Harding 1994;
Hartmann
1994, 1996; Hurley 1994; Lamb 1997; Mészáros 1997). Compared to
the observational situation in the 1970’s and 1980’s (for a review,
see Higdon &amp; Lingenfelter 1990; Houston &amp; Wolfendale 1983; Puget
1981) this evidence represented substantial progress. However, it also
meant that the distance scale of the bursters was still unknown by
orders of magnitude, lying either at the kpc level or in the Gpc range
(for a detailed study see, e.g., Mao &amp; Paczyński 1992a,b).
Correspondingly uncertain was the GRB luminosity distribution.
The arguments for and against GRBs inside or outside the Galaxy led
to a lively debate, which was eventually presented to
the general public (see the dedicated publications of
’The Great Debate’: Fishman 1995; Lamb 1995; Nemiroff 1995;
Paczyński 1995; Rees 1995; Trimble 1995).</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The most promising way to distinguish between the Galactic halo model
and the cosmological model of GRBs seemed to be either to check
with high precision the angular isotropy of the bursts on the sky
(cf. Briggs et al. 1996; Hakkila et al. 1994; Lamb 1997; Tegmark et
al. 1996b), or to search for GRBs and
their accompanying optical and X-ray flashes from a potential Galactic
halo population of bursters in M 31 (cf. Klose 1995a;
Lamb 1995; Li &amp; Liang 1992).
Evidence for the latter was not found, but the former method
worked very well and based on <span id="S2.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">BATSE </span>gamma-ray data alone over
the years it became more and more difficult to postulate a Galactic
halo origin of all bursts. This included constraints on
burst repetition (cf. Meegan et al. 1995; Tegmark et al. 1996a).</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">There have been several other proposals to determine the distance
scale of the bursters (cf. Paczyński 1991a,b). <span id="S2.SS1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">At gamma-ray
energies </span>these investigations involved attempts to detect a
cosmological signature in GRB durations and spectral hardness
(cf. Brainerd 1994; Fenimore &amp; Bloom 1995;
Horack, Mallozzi, &amp; Koshut 1996; Lee &amp; Petrosian 1997;
Norris et al. 1994, 1995), studies of
luminosity function effects on the observed brightness distribution of
the bursts (cf. Fenimore et al. 1993;
Horváth, Mészáros, &amp; Mészáros 1996; Mao &amp;
Paczyński 1992a; Mészáros &amp; Mészáros 1995, 1996;
Mészáros et al. 1996), analyses of the spectral energy
distribution of the bursts in combination with pair production
opacities in GRB photon fields (cf. Baring &amp; Harding 1998), and
theoretical estimates of the energy reservoir of potential Galactic
neutron stars as GRB sources (cf. Hartmann &amp; Narayan 1996). <span id="S2.SS1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">In
the X-ray band </span>a Galactic origin of the burster population would
have been revealed by scattering and absorption of GRB X-rays by the
Galactic interstellar medium (Klose 1994, 1995b; Owens, Schaefer, &amp;
Sembay 1995). However, this required a dedicated X-ray satellite,
which was not available at that time. <span id="S2.SS1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">At optical/infrared/radio
wavelengths </span>one way was to perform rapid follow-up searches for
transients following or accompanying GRBs, the occurrence of which was
predicted in theoretical models (cf. Mészáros, Rees, &amp; Papathanassiou
1994). Another way was to look for a potential GRB source population
in GRB error boxes. Both strategies were confronted with the problem
that <span id="S2.SS1.p4.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">BATSE </span>1<math id="S2.SS1.p4.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\sigma" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.SS1.p4.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S2.SS1.p4.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.SS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml">σ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.SS1.p4.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S2.SS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS1.p4.1.m1.1.1">𝜎</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-llamapun" id="S2.SS1.p4.1.m1.1c">italic-sigma</annotation><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.SS1.p4.1.m1.1d">\sigma</annotation></semantics></math> error boxes are several degrees in radius
(cf. Briggs et al. 1999). Although this is a very small localization
size for a gamma-ray telescope, it is a giant error box for follow-up
observations in the radio, optical, or near-infrared bands. Searches
for optical transients in GRB error boxes on wide-field
photographic plates fortuitously taken at the right time and area of
the sky have been one method to address the problem (cf. Greiner et al. 1992;
Schaefer 1990; for a review, see Hudec 1993).
In general, this method was not very
efficient since the chance of finding suitable photographic plates
is very small (cf. Greiner et al. 1996), and variable stars could
mimic optical transients (cf. Greiner &amp; Motch 1995; Hudec &amp; Wenzel
1996; Klose 1995c;
Pedersen 1994). Indeed, these searches did not lead to the unambiguous
detection of a GRB source. A more promising way was to set-up automatic
wide-field cameras, which could be triggered on-line by GRB detections
on board the <span id="S2.SS1.p4.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">CGRO</span>. Based on dedicated international
distribution networks for GRB data (cf. Barthelmy et al. 1998; Kippen
et al. 1998a; McNamara, Harrison, &amp; Williams 1995), response times
on the order of seconds were
achieved, however no optical transients were discovered with this
method either (cf. Akerlof et al. 1995; Lee et al. 1997; Park et
al. 1997; Vanderspek, Krimm, &amp; Ricker 1995).</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Another technique to observe a burster was based on GRB error
boxes provided by the Interplanetary Network (IPN) of
satellites operating in the solar system (cf. Laros et al. 1998). For
most of the 1990’s the IPN consisted only of <span id="S2.SS1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Ulysses-</span>spacecraft (cf. Hurley et al. 1995) and <span id="S2.SS1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">CGRO</span>. The IPN makes
use of the light travel time delays between different satellites to
localize a burst on the sky (cf. Cline et al. 1980). Compared to <span id="S2.SS1.p5.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">BATSE</span>-only error boxes, if triggered, the IPN can provide GRB error
boxes with considerable smaller sizes (for a review, see Lund 1995),
but not in real-time. International campaigns of follow-up
observations of the most promising half-dozen well-localized IPN
bursts only provided upper limits to the flux density of any transient
source in the X-ray, optical, or radio band (cf. Frail et al. 1994;
Galama et al. 1997a; Greiner et al. 1997a; Hurley et al. 1994; Laros
et al. 1997; Palmer et al. 1995; Pedersen 1994;
Schaefer et al. 1994; for a review,
see McNamara, Harrison, &amp; Williams 1995). Furthermore, deep surveys
of arcmin-sized IPN error boxes have been performed, mostly months or
years after the corresponding burst, with the aim of finding evidence
for a statistical excess of a certain class of astronomical objects in
GRB error boxes. No unambiguous GRB sources were found in the optical (cf.
Gorosabel et al. 1995; Schaefer et al. 1997; Vrba, Hartmann, &amp;
Jennings 1995; Webber et al. 1995), although in the case of quasars
and active galactic nuclei the situation is still somewhat
controversial (cf. Burenin et al. 1998; Fruchter et al. 1999b; Hurley
et al. 1999a; Luginbuhl et al. 1995, 1996; Schartel, Andernach, &amp;
Greiner 1997; Vrba et al. 1994, 1999a).
Similar surveys in the radio
(cf. Palmer et al. 1995; Schaefer et al. 1989), the X-ray band
(cf. Boër et al. 1993, 1997; Greiner et al. 1991;
Hurley et al. 1999b; Pizzichini et
al. 1986), and the near-infrared (Blaes et al. 1997; Klose,
Eislöffel, &amp; Richter 1996; Klose et al. 1998; Larson &amp; McLean
1997; Larson, McLean, &amp; Becklin 1996) also failed to identify the
burster population. The deepest optical survey (Vrba, Hartmann, &amp;
Jennings 1995) and the near-infrared surveys revealed, however, that
there is no lack of potential GRB host galaxies in IPN error boxes.
The missing item was the direct observational proof of an
extragalactic origin of the bursts.
This second observational breakthrough was initiated by the
Italian-Dutch gamma-ray/X-ray satellite <span id="S2.SS1.p5.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">BeppoSAX </span>launched in
1996 (Boella et al. 1997; Costa et al. 1998; Frontera 1998),
and later it included successful GRB localizations with RXTE
(see Bradt &amp; Smith 1999; Smith et al. 1999). It
characterizes the period from 1997 to 1999. The observational
situation before that time is summarized by e.g. Greiner (1995), Lamb
(1997), McNamara, Harrison, &amp; Williams (1995), Mészáros (1997),
and Vrba (1996).</p>

either in the optical (cf. Galama et al. 1997b) or in the radio band

observational breakthrough was near. It came with GRB 970228 (Costa et

was discovered (Groot et al. 1997; van Paradijs et al. 1997), meaning

milestone on this route. Various aspects of these exciting, new
discoveries have been summarized by numerous authors from the
theoretical as well as from the observational point of view (e.g.,
Blinnikov 1999; Castro-Tirado 1999; Frontera 1998; Ghisellini 1999;

<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The occurrence of broad-band afterglows following GRBs was expected
on theoretical grounds (cf. Rees 1998, and references
therein). Compared to the duration of the bursts, afterglows in the
long-wavelengths bands can be long-lived, making the precise
localization of the bursters possible and extending GRB research into
international multi-wavelength observing campaigns. Greiner’s
WWW-page at the Astrophysical Institute Potsdam (see appendix)
provides informations about ongoing observational activities in GRB
follow-up studies.</p>

<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">According to the currently most accepted theoretical GRB model, the
afterglows are due to external shocks when a relativistically
expanding fireball (a <math id="S3.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\gamma" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.p2.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S3.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S3.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">γ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.p2.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S3.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.p2.1.m1.1.1">𝛾</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-llamapun" id="S3.p2.1.m1.1c">italic-gamma</annotation><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.p2.1.m1.1d">\gamma</annotation></semantics></math>-ray fireball, see Cavallo &amp; Rees 1978)
released by a compact source sweeps up matter from
the “interstellar” medium surrounding the burster (for an introduction
into this subject and/or a review, see Mészáros 1997, 1999a; Piran
1997, 1999a,b; Rees 1999). This medium could be, for example, the
ordinary interstellar medium in a spiral galaxy, or the stellar wind
environment from the GRB progenitor (cf. Chevalier &amp; Li 1999; Halpern
et al. 1999). The afterglow emission process is most likely synchrotron
radiation (see, e.g., Sari, Piran, &amp; Narayan 1998; Wijers, Rees, &amp;
Mészáros 1997, and references therein).</p>

<div id="S3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">At the date of submission of this review, long-lasting
optical afterglows have been observed from about a dozen
GRBs, and about ten radio afterglows were discovered (see
Greiner’s WWW-page [appendix];
see also Table 2 in Wheeler 1999). Evidence for a short-lived
afterglow in the gamma-ray band has been reported too (Giblin et
al. 1999). About half of all GRB afterglows seen in the X-ray band
showed no detectable optical emission, whereas almost all
GRBs detected by <span id="S3.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">BeppoSAX </span>exhibited an X-ray
afterglow (Costa 1999).</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To date, there are eleven reported spectroscopic redshift measurements of
GRB afterglows and/or host galaxies (mid December
1999; Table 1), confirming the cosmological distance scale of GRBs, which
was considered soon after their discovery (e.g., Usov &amp; Chibisov 1975;
van den Bergh 1983; Paczyński 1987). The data seem to indicate that the
redshift distribution of the bursters peaks around 1, with a long
tail towards higher redshifts (for model fits see, e.g., Schmidt
1999). There is also one burst that came from the local universe

extragalactic nature is not yet completely solved, however (cf. Cline,
Matthey, &amp; Otwinowski 1999; Tavani 1998).</p>

magnitude of about 18…22 when it is detected some hours after the
burst, provided that no strong extinction occurs in the GRB host
galaxy or in our Galaxy. This can make the optical transient
detectable to 1-m class telescopes.
For example, the optical afterglow of GRB 970508 was
discovered with the Kitt Peak 0.9-m reflector (Bond 1997), the
afterglow of GRB 980329 with the Tautenburg 1.34-m (Klose, Meusinger,
&amp; Lehmann 1998; Reichart et al. 1999), and the afterglow of GRB
990308 with the Venezuelan 1-m Schmidt telescope (Schaefer et
al. 1999). The burst 980329 is the only GRB afterglow detected in
the submm-band (Smith et al. 1999). Presumably, there was something
special about this burst, which is also indicated by the color of its
afterglow (for a discussion see, e.g., Draine 1999; Fruchter 1999;
in ’t Zand et al. 1998; Palazzi et al. 1998). Detailed color
measurements of afterglows are published for, e.g., GRB 980703
(Vreeswijk et al. 1999) and 990510 (Israel et al. 1999).</p>

dimming of the optical transient by 3 photometric magnitudes between
day 1 and day 10 after the occurrence of the burst. Rapid follow-up
observations are therefore crucial for the detection of GRB
afterglows. Exceptions to this rule do occur, however. The afterglow
flux of GRB 970508 showed a fall and rise during the first 2 days,
before it entered a power-law decline (cf. Castro-Tirado et al. 1997;
Fruchter et al. 1999b; Pedersen et al. 1998; for a possible
theoretical explanation, see Panaitescu, Mészáros, &amp; Rees 1998;

<p id="S3.p7.1" class="ltx_p">In its early phase a GRB afterglow can outshine its host galaxy, which
becomes visible weeks or months after the burst when the light curve
of the afterglow seems to flatten. This was first seen for GRB 970508
(Zharikov &amp; Sokolov 1999). This was also the first burst where a
radio counterpart of the afterglow was detected with the
Very Large Array (VLA) which
suggested extreme relativistic expansion velocities of the radio
source (Frail et al. 1997b; Waxman, Kulkarni, &amp; Frail 1998) based on
the radio scintillation technique (Goodman 1997). Meanwhile, it has
been proven that observations in the radio band can localize GRB

of electromagnetic energy released (Table 1). This is especially
apparent in the case of GRB 990123, where an optical flash was
detected for the first time when the burst was still in progress in the
gamma-ray band (Akerlof et al. 1999). This phenomenon was predicted
from theory (Mészáros 1999a, and references therein; Sari &amp;

GRB 971214 (Kulkarni et al. 1998a). The term ’hypernova’ (Paczyński
1998a,b) has become a popular word to describe such energetic events.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Two basic ideas are being discussed on how to reduce the
required energy budget; gravitational lensing and non-isotropic
emission. This discussion peaked when GRB 990123 was detected and its
redshift measured (see the archive of the GCN circulars; appendix).
Direct observational support for lensing has never been found in GRB data
(cf. Marani et al. 1999) but evidence for beaming seems to be present.
Beaming reduces the energy requirement by a factor of order 10–100,
depending on the assumed or calculated solid angle of emission, but it
increases by the same factor the required GRB event rate.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">It was recently predicted that beaming of the relativistic
outflow should lead to a break in the afterglow light curve
(Mészáros &amp; Rees 1999b; Panaitescu, Mészáros, &amp; Rees 1998;
Piran 1999b; Rhoads 1997, 1999; Sari, Piran, &amp; Halpern 1999) and to a
non-zero and time-dependent polarization in the optical/near-infrared
(Ghisellini &amp; Lazzati 1999; Gruzinov 1999; Sari 1999). This is
expected to occur when the decreasing bulk Lorentz-factor of the
radiating shock front which runs into the ambient interstellar medium
of the burster allows the observer to see the edge of the jet (Piran
[1999b] notes that ’jet’ is not the appropriate description of the
phenomenon, since this is a transient collimated outflow). The
smaller the opening angle of the jet, the earlier the observer
should see a break, a steepening in the afterglow light curve. Within
this theoretical context it would be interesting to learn if a
time-delayed signal from the counterjet is expected to be seen too.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Observational evidence for beaming was first found in the optical
afterglow of GRB 990123, where the light curve steepened two days
after the burst (Castro-Tirado et al. 1999; Kulkarni et al. 1999). The
measured steepening is in agreement with the picture that at this time
the observer began to see the edge of a jet. Recently, a steepening in
the light curve has also been observed for another burst, GRB 990510
(Beuermann et al. 1999; Harrison et al. 1999; Stanek et al. 1999). In
both cases a beaming factor in the order of 200…300 has been
deduced from the observations (Harrison et al. 1999; Mészáros
1999b; Sari, Piran, &amp; Halpern 1999). This seems to bring very
energetic bursts to the energy output of less energetic ones (Table
1), for which no observational evidence for strong beaming has been
found, like GRB 970228 and 970508 (Sari, Piran, &amp; Halpern 1999).
More afterglow observations are required, however, to check this
hypothesis.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p5.1" class="ltx_p">An exciting consequence of beaming is that there could exist GRBs
which develop an X-ray, optical, or radio afterglow, but have no
detected gamma-ray burst (for a discussion see, e.g., Mészáros,
Rees, &amp; Wijers 1998, 1999; Perna &amp; Loeb 1998b; Rhoads 1997). Archived X-ray
data have been searched for such events, but no strong evidence for
them was found (Greiner et al. 1999a,b; Grindlay 1999).
However, possible evidence for a relation of optical transients detected
on photographic plates to underlying blue galaxies
was reported by Hudec et al. (1996). Results of wide-field CCD surveys
to search for this phenomenon have not yet been published.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p6.1" class="ltx_p">There are numerous possible causes for a break in the light curve of
an afterglow (for a discussion see, e.g., Kulkarni et al. 1999; Wei &amp;
Lu 1999). An independent observational test for beaming is therefore
desirable. It could be provided
by polarimetric observations. According to recent theoretical studies,
optical afterglows could be linearly polarized up to the 10% level if
the radiation comes from a collimated outflow moving with relativistic
velocity toward the observer and the observer is not directed exactly
at the center of the jet (Ghisellini &amp; Lazzati 1999; Gruzinov 1999;
Sari 1999; see also Hughes, Aller, &amp; Aller 1985). However,
microlensing is also considered as a possible option for producing
time-dependent linearly polarized afterglows (Loeb &amp; Perna 1998a). If
the degree of linear polarization of an afterglow can be as high as
predicted, even if no beaming occurs (Gruzinov &amp; Waxman 1999), this
could allow observers to detect an afterglow in a GRB error box at
high Galactic latitude without the need of second-epoch data. This
holds particularly in the near-infrared bands (Klose, Stecklum, &amp;
Fischer 1999).</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Linear polarization was first detected at the 2% level in the
afterglow of GRB 990510 about 1…2 days after the burst based on
observations with the ESO Very Large Telescope (Covino et al. 1999; Wijers et
al. 1999). Unfortunately, only three data points could be obtained, and within
the measurement errors no time-dependency of the degree of linear
polarization was found. However, such a time-dependence appears to be
present in the afterglow of GRB 990712 (Rol et al. 1999).</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Among the most exciting discoveries about the nature of the GRBs is
the bimodality of their duration distribution (Kouveliotou et
al. 1993; Mazets et al. 1981; McBreen et al. 1994). Recently,
evidence for an intermediate class of bursts was also reported
(Horváth 1998; Mukherjee et al. 1998). Short burst durations range
between 0.01 to 2 seconds, long bursts last from about 2 to a few
hundred seconds. Since <span id="S5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">BeppoSAX </span>is only sensitive to long
bursts, it is currently unknown whether short bursts do also produce
detectable GRB afterglows. It is also unknown what the origin of this
bimodality is although various studies have been performed to gain
insights into this issue (cf. Balázs, Mészáros, &amp; Horváth 1998;
Balázs et al. 1999; Dezalay et al. 1996;
Katz &amp; Canel 1996; Mao, Narayan, &amp; Piran 1994;
Mészáros, Bagoly, &amp; Vavrek 1999; Mitrofanov 1998).</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">One working hypothesis is that the bimodal duration
distribution reflects different GRB engines. According
to the most accepted picture of the bursters today, GRBs can be made
either by merger events that include compact stars and/or stellar-mass
black holes, or by the gravitational collapse of single stars
(cf. Fryer &amp; Woosley 1998; Fryer, Woosley, &amp;
Hartmann 1999; Fryer et al. 1999; in ’t Zand 1998;
Ruffert &amp; Janka 1998, 1999; Woosley, MacFadyen, &amp; Heger 1999; for a
discussion see also, e.g., Mészáros 1999a; Rees 1999). In all
cases it is believed that the relic of the explosion is a
stellar-mass black hole. In other words, within this picture every
detected GRB (excluding SGR bursts) represents either a black hole
formation event in the universe, or at least a signal from a
pre-existing stellar-mass black hole.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Although the central engine of a GRB is hidden from observation,
both classes of burst models make certain predictions that can be
tested by observations, mainly based on the ages of the objects
involved (cf. Bloom, Sigurdsson, &amp; Pols 1999; Fryer, Woosley, &amp; Hartmann
1999). As noted by Paczyński (1998b), massive stars will be close to
their birthplaces when they explode and hence they could be embedded
in a dust-rich environment. Several pieces of evidence seem to
favor this GRB model: <span id="S5.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">First, </span>within the context of the
fireball models, multi-wavelength observations of afterglows can be
used to determine the gas density of the “interstellar” medium

1999). Model fits led to the conclusion that the density of
the external medium into which the fireball of GRB 980329 expands

core that formed a black hole can explain the observations (Iwamoto

in conflict with the fireball model (Iwamoto 1999; for the optical
light curve see McKenzie &amp; Schaefer 1999). Since GRB 980425 was so

<p id="S6.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Although up to December 1999 no other direct GRB-SN association has been
found, there is in fact increasing observational evidence that
at least a subclass of all bursts is associated with SNe. The
strongest evidence comes from the recent discovery that the light
curves of GRB 970228, 980326, and possibly 990712, show a bump at late
times which cannot be explained within the context of simple afterglow
models, but can be fitted as a redshifted SN 1998bw light curve which
adds to the flux of the GRB afterglow (Bloom et al. 1999a; Dar 1999;
Galama et al. 1999; Hjorth et al. 1999; Reichart 1999). If that
interpretation is correct, then GRB 970228, the first burst with a
detected optical afterglow, represents one of the most distant SNe
ever seen (<math id="S6.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="z" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.p3.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S6.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S6.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml">z</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.p3.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S6.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p3.1.m1.1.1">𝑧</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-llamapun" id="S6.p3.1.m1.1c">italic-z</annotation><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.p3.1.m1.1d">z</annotation></semantics></math>=0.695; Djorgovski et al. 1999). Moreover, if it turns
out that SN light curves do appear in GRB afterglows, this
could represent a new powerful method to measure the
cosmological parameters. A check of this potential application might be an
interesting long-term project for 8-m class optical telescopes.</p>

emission line in the X-ray afterglows of GRB 970508 (Piro et
al. 1999a,b) and possibly GRB 970828 (Yoshida et al. 1999)
has been reported, which could
indicate an SN event before the corresponding GRB (Lazzati,
Campana, &amp; Ghisellini 1999; Vietri &amp; Stella 1998).
Naturally, because of these findings the question arises if all
GRBs are physically related to SNe.
Several authors have therefore compared the <span id="S6.p4.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">BATSE
</span>GRB catalog (Meegan et al. 1998) with SN catalogs (Bloom et
al. 1998a; Hudec, Hudcova, &amp; Hroch 1999; Kippen et al. 1998b; Klose
1999; Norris, Bonnell, &amp; Watanabe 1999; Wang &amp; Wheeler 1998).
However, no convincing statistical evidence for an excess of any
subclass of SNe in GRB error boxes has been found in that way. The
reason for this is that <span id="S6.p4.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">BATSE</span>-only error boxes are very large
in radius and that the SN database is very inhomogeneous. Therefore, these
studies cannot exclude the existence of a general association of GRBs
to SNe. In any case, GRB research gives a strong impulse to SN research
(Wheeler 1999; Woosley, MacFadyen, &amp; Heger 1999). If GRBs do indeed
reflect certain SN explosions, <span id="S6.p4.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">BATSE </span>detects more SNe per year than all
current SN search campaigns combined.</p>

<p id="S6.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Based on these findings, is it possible that we have already seen a
few SN-GRBs in our Galactic neighborhood but not recognized them as
such? A search for potential GRB afterglows in the CBAT SN catalog has
not been successful (Klose 1999), although such a study is confronted
with the lack of detailed observational data about most known SNe.
Another way to tackle the question under consideration is to look
for bright, nearby galaxies in arcmin-sized IPN error boxes.
A working hypothesis can be that a SN-GRB association was not
recognized in these cases because these GRB error boxes could not be determined
in a timely manner, i.e., any SN light curve was already below the
detection threshold when these error boxes were imaged in the
optical. A visual inspection of published optical images of
IPN error boxes of the 1970’s
(cf. Schaefer et al. 1998; Vrba, Hartmann, &amp; Jennings 1995)

The
latter estimate is uncertain however, because the redshift is so
small. Similar to the duration of GRB 980425 (Galama et al. 1998a;
Pian et al. 1999), the duration of GRB 781104b was about 30 seconds
(Mazets et al. 1981; Teegarden &amp; Cline 1980). Although no SN is
known in MCG 04-47-011, another way to check whether
GRB 781104b was a nearby SN burst could be to search in the radio band for
its potential GRB remnant.</p>

Efremov, Elmegreen, &amp; Hodge (1998) as well as Loeb &amp; Perna
(1998b) brought attention to HI supershells (cf. Lee &amp; Irwin
1997; Walter et al. 1998), whose energy content is comparable to the
electromagnetic energy release of GRBs. Potential X-ray selected
GRB remnant candidates in M 101 have also been proposed (Wang
1999). First calculations of the emission spectrum of GRB remnants
have been published and phenomenological differences to supernova
remnants (SNRs) have been outlined (Perna, Raymond, &amp; Loeb
1999). Since there are some similarities to SNRs, however, in the
optical the search strategy for GRB remnant candidates could follow
those for HII-regions/SNRs (cf. Elmegreen &amp; Salzer 1999; Gordon et
al. 1993; Matonick &amp; Fesen 1997). The close-by, face-on spirals
M 33 and NGC 300 could be potential targets for such an
investigation.</p>

Does any subclass of GRBs represent a cosmological

a useful tool to investigate the interstellar medium in our Galaxy

<p id="S7.p8.1" class="ltx_p">I am deeply indebted to Bringfried Stecklum (Thüringer
Landessternwarte Tautenburg) and Olaf Fischer
(Universitäts-Sternwarte Jena), who share my interest in
GRBs and their afterglows. I am grateful to Jochen Greiner (Astrophysical
Institute Potsdam), Dieter Hartmann (Clemson University, Clemson,
SC), Attila Mészáros (Astronomical Institute, Charles University
Prague), Bringfried Stecklum, and Fred Vrba (U.S. Naval Observatory,
Flagstaff, AZ) for many valuable comments on the manuscript. I thank
Josef Solf for his interest in and support of GRB research during his
tenure as director of the Thüringer Landessternwarte Tautenburg
in the years 1994-99. I greatly appreciate assistance during observing
campaigns at the Calar Alto Observatory, Spain, from Kurt Birkle,
Ulrich Thiele, and Markus Feldt, Max-Planck-Institut für Astronomie,
Heidelberg. This research has made use of the Simbad database,
operated at CDS, Strasbourg, France.</p>
